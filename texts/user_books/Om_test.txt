With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the city
Omelas, bright-towered by the sea. The ringing of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. In the
streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown 
gardens and under avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions moved.

Some were decorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and gray, grave master workmen,
quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked. In other streets the music
beat faster, a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession
was a dance. Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights
over the music and the singing. 

All the processions wound towards the north side of the city,
where on the great water-meadow called the Green Fields boys and girls, naked in the bright air,
with mud-stained feet and ankles and long, lithe arms,exercised their restive horses before the
race. 

The horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit. Their manes were braided with
streamers of silver, gold, and green. They flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one
another; they were vastly excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted our
ceremonies as his own. 

Far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling
Omelas on her bay. The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the Eighteen
Peaks burned with white-gold fire across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark blue of the sky.
There was just enough wind to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter
now and then. 

In the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding
throughout the city streets, farther and nearer and ever approaching, a cheerful faint sweetness
of the air from time to time trembled and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous
clanging of the bells.
