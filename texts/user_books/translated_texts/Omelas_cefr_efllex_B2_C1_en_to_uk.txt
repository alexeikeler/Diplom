The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas   With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, [soaring - ширяючий]  the Festival of Summer came to the city Omelas, bright-towered by the sea.

The ringing of the boats in harbor  [harbor - гавань] sparkled with flags.

In the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown  gardens and under avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions moved.  

Some were decorous: old people in long stiff  [stiff - твердий] robes of mauve and gray, grave master  [master - майстер] workmen, [workmen - робочі]  quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked.

In other streets the music beat faster, a shimmering of gong  [gong - гонг] and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession  [procession - процесія] was a dance.

Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights over the music and the singing.   

All the processions wound  [wound - рана] towards the north side of the city, where on the great water-meadow called the Green Fields boys and girls, naked  [naked - голий] in the bright air, with mud-stained  [stained - заплямований] feet and ankles and long, lithe arms,exercised their restive horses before the race.   

The horses wore no gear  [gear - спорядження] at all but a halter without bit.

Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green.

They flared their nostrils  [nostrils - ніздрі] and pranced and boasted  [boasted - хвастова] to one another; they were vastly excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own.   

Far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling Omelas on her bay. [bay - затока] 

The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the Eighteen Peaks burned with white-gold fire across the miles of sunlit  [sunlit - освітлений сонцем] air, under the dark blue of the sky.

In the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding  [winding - звивистий] throughout the city streets, farther and nearer and ever approaching, [approaching - наближення]  a cheerful faint sweetness of the air from time to time trembled and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells.  

Joyous!

How is one to tell about joy?

How describe the citizens of Omelas?

They were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy.

But we do not say the words of cheer  [cheer - підбадьорення] much any more.

All smiles have become archaic.

Given a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions. [assumptions - припущення]    

Given a description such as this one tends to look next for the King, mounted  [mounted - монтований] on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble  [noble - шляхетний] knights, or perhaps in a golden  [golden - золотий] litter  [litter - послід] borne by great-muscled slaves.

But there was no king.

They did not use swords, [swords - мечі]  or keep slaves.

They were not barbarians, I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I suspect  [suspect - підозрюваний] that they were singularly few.   

As they did without monarchy and slavery, [slavery - рабство]  so they also got on without the stock  [stock - запас] exchange,  the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb.

Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk,  not dulcet shepherds, noble  [noble - благородний] savages, bland utopians.

There were not less complex than us.  

The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid.

Only pain is intellectual, [intellectual - інтелектуальний]  only evil  [evil - зло] interesting.

If you can't lick  [lick - лизати] 'em, join 'em.

If it hurts, repeat it.   

But to praise  [praise - хвалити] despair is to condemn  [condemn - засуджувати] delight, to embrace  [embrace - обіймати] violence is to lose hold of everything else.  

We have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.

How can I tell you about the people of Omelas?

They were not naive  [naive - наївний] and happy children--though their children were, in fact, happy.

They were mature, [mature - зрілий]  intelligent, passionate  [passionate - пристрасний] adults whose lives were not wretched.

O miracle! [miracle - диво] 

But I wish I could describe it better.   

I wish I could convince you.

Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale,  long ago and far away, once upon a time.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own  fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion,for certainly I cannot suit you all.  

For instance, how about technology?

I think that there would be no cars or helicopters  [helicopters - вертольоти] in and above the streets;  this follows from the fact that the people of Omelas are happy people.   

Happiness is based on a just discrimination  [discrimination - дискримінація] of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, [destructive - деструктивний]  [destructive - руйнівний]  and what is destructive.

In the middle category, however--that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, [exuberance - буйство]  etc.-they could  perfectly well have central heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light-sources, fuelless power, a cure for the common cold.

Or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter.   

As you like it.

I incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming  to to Omelas during the last days before the Festival on very fast little trains and double-decked trams,  and that the trains station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though plainer than the magnificent  [magnificent - розкішний] Farmers' Market.   

But even granted trains, I fear  [fear - страх] that Omelas so far strikes some of you as goody-goody.  

If an orgy  [orgy - оргія] would help, don't hesitate.

Let us not, however, have temples  [temples - храми] from which issue  [issue - питання] beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires  [desires - бажання] union with the deep  [deep - глибина] godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea.   

But really it would be better not to have any temples  [temples - храми]  [temples - храми] in Omelas--at least, not manned  [manned - пілотований] temples.

Religion yes, clergy no.

Surely the beautiful nudes can just wander  [wander - блукати] about, offering themselves like divine  [divine - божественний] souffles to the hunger  [hunger - голод] of the needy  [needy - нужденний] and the rapture of the flesh. [flesh - плоть] 

Let them join the processions.   

But what else should there be?   

I thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical.

For those who like it, the faint  insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great  lightness and brilliance  [brilliance - блиск] to the mind and limbs, [limbs - кінцівки]  and then after some hours a dreamy  [dreamy - мрійливий] languor, and wonderful visions at last of the very arcane and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex beyond all belief; and it is not habit-forming.

For more modest  [modest - скромний] tastes I think there ought to be beer.

What else, what else belongs in the joyous city?   

The sense of victory, surely, the celebration of courage.

But as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers.

The joy built upon successful slaughter  [slaughter - забій] is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. [trivial - дріб’язковий]    

A boundless and generous contentment, a magnanimous triumph  [triumph - тріумф] felt not against some outer enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's summer: This is what swells the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the victory they celebrate is that of life.

I don't think many of them need to take drooz.  

Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now.

A marvelous smell of cooking goes forth  [forth - вперед] from the red and blue tents of the provisioners.

The faces of small children are amiably sticky; in the benign  [benign - доброякісні] gray beard of a man a couple of crumbs  [crumbs - крихти] of rich pastry are entangled.

The youths and girls have mounted  [mounted - монтований] their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course.

An old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, [basket - кошик]  and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair.   

A child of nine or ten sits at the edge of the crowd alone, playing on a wooden flute.

People pause to listen, and they smile, but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases  [ceases - припиняється] playing and never sees them, his dark eyes wholly  [wholly - повністю] rapt in the sweet, thing magic of the tune.

He finishes, and slowly lowers  [lowers - опускається] his hands holding the wooden flute.  

As if that little private silence were the signal, all at once a trumpet sounds from the pavilion near the starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing.

The horses rear on their slender legs, and some of them neigh in answer.   

"Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope..."

They begin to form in rank along the starting line.

The crowds along the racecourse are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind.

The Festival of Summer has begun.  

Do you believe?

Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy?

No?

Then let me describe one more thing.

In a basement  [basement - підвал] under one of the beautiful public buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar  [cellar - льох] of one of its spacious  [spacious - просторий] private homes, there is a room.

It has one locked door, and no window.   

A little light seeps in dustily between cracks  [cracks - тріщини] in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar. [cellar - льох] 

In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff, [stiff - жорсткий]  clotted, foul-smelling heads, stand near a rusty  [rusty - іржавий] bucket.

The floor is dirt, a little damp to the touch, as cellar  [cellar - льох] dirt usually is.  

The room is about three paces long and two wide: a mere  [mere - просто] broom closet or disused tool room.

In the room, a child is sitting.

It could be a boy or a girl.

It looks about six, but actually is nearly ten.

It is feeble-minded. [minded - налаштований] 

Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. [neglect - нехтування] 

It picks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops.   

It is afraid of the mops.

It finds them horrible.

It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still standing there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come.

The door is always locked; and nobody ever comes, except that sometimes--the child has no understanding  [understanding - розуміння] of time or interval- [interval - інтервал] -sometimes the door rattles terribly  [terribly - жахливо] and opens, and a person, or several people, are there.

One of them may come in and kick the child to make it stand up.

The people at the door never say anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can remember sunlight and its mother's voice, sometimes speaks.

"I will be good, " it says.

"Please let me out.

I will be good!"

They never answer.

The child used to scream for help at night, and cry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining, "eh-haa, eh-haa," and it speaks less and less often.  

It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its belly protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a day.

It is naked. [naked - голі] 

Its buttocks and thighs  [thighs - стегна] are a mass  [mass - маса] of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually. [continually - постійно]   

They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas.

Some of them have come to see it, others are content  [content - зміст] merely  [merely - лише] to know it is there.

They all know that it has to be there.

Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness  [tenderness - ніжність] of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom  [wisdom - мудрість] of their scholars, [scholars - вчені]  the skill of their makers, even the abundance  [abundance - достаток] of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly  [wholly - цілковито] on this child's abominable misery. [misery - злигодні]   

This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they seem capable of understanding; [understanding - розуміння]  and most of those who come to see the child are young people, though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child.

No matter how well the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators  [spectators - глядачі] are always shocked and sickened at the sight.

They would like to do something for the child.

But there is nothing they can do.

If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity  [prosperity - процвітання] and beauty and delight of Omelas would wither and be destroyed.

Those are the terms.   

To exchange all the goodness  [goodness - доброта] and grace  [grace - благодать] of every life in Omelas for that single, small improvement: to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of happiness of one: that would be to let guilt  [guilt - провина] within the walls indeed.

The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child.

Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, [rage - лют]  when they have seen the child and faced this terrible paradox. [paradox - парадокс]    

They may brood over it for weeks or years.

But as time goes on they begin to realize that even if the child could be released,  it would not get much good of its freedom: a little vague  [vague - розпливчастий] pleasure of warmth and food, no real doubt, but little more.  

It is too degraded and imbecile to know any real joy.

It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear.  

Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond to humane  [humane - гуманний] treatment.

Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without walls about it to protect it, and darkness  [darkness - темрява] for its eyes, and its own excrement to sit in.  

Their tears at the bitter injustice  [injustice - несправедливість] dry when they begin to perceive  [perceive - сприймати] the terrible justice of reality, and to accept it.

Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity  [generosity - щедрість] and the acceptance  [acceptance - прийняття] of their helplessness, [helplessness - безпорадність]  which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives.

Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible  [irresponsible - безвідповідальність] happiness.

They know that they, like the child, are not free.

It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children.   

They know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, could make no joyful music as the young riders  [riders - вершники] line  [line - лінія] up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first morning of summer.  

Now do you believe them?

Are they not more credible? [credible - вірогідний] 

But there is one more thing to tell, and this is quite incredible.

At times one of the adolescent  [adolescent - підліток] girls or boys who go see the child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all.  

Sometimes also a man or a woman much older falls silent for a day or two, then leaves home.

These people go out into the street, and walk down the street alone.

They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the beautiful gates.

They keep walking across the farmlands of Omelas.

Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman.  

Night falls; the traveler must pass down village streets, between the houses with yellow- lit windows, and on out into the darkness  [darkness - тьма] of the fields.

Each alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains.

They go on.

They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, [darkness - тьма]  and they do not come back.   

The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness.

I cannot describe it at all.

It is possible that it does not exist.

But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.
