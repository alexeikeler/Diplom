“ The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas”    With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring [soaring - парящий], the Festival of Summer came to the city Omelas, bright- towered by the sea.

The ringing of the boats in harbor [harbor - гавань] sparkled with flags.

In the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss [moss - мох]- grown   gardens and under avenues [avenues - проспекты] of trees, past great parks and public [public - публичный] buildings, processions moved. 

Some were decorous: old people in long stiff [stiff - жесткий] robes of mauve and gray, grave master [master - владелец] workmen [workmen - рабочие], quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked.

In other streets the music beat [beat - бить] faster, a shimmering of gong [gong - гонг] and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession [procession - шествие] was a dance.

Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising [rising - рост] like the swallows' crossing flights over the music and the singing. 

All the processions wound [wound - ранить] towards the north side of the city, where on the great water- meadow called the Green Fields boys and girls, naked [naked - голый] in the bright air, with mud [mud - грязь]- stained [stained - окрашенный] feet [feet - ноги] and ankles and long, lithe arms, exercised their restive horses before the race [race - раса]. 

The horses wore no gear [gear - механизм] at all but a halter without bit.

Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green.

They flared their nostrils [nostrils - ноздри] and pranced and boasted [boasted - хвастался] to one another; they were vastly [vastly - сильно] excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted [adopted - усыновленный] our ceremonies [ceremonies - церемонии] as his own. 

Far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling Omelas on her bay [bay - залив].

The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the Eighteen Peaks burned [burned - сгорел] with white- gold fire across the miles [miles - мили] of sunlit [sunlit - залитый солнцем] air, under the dark blue of the sky.

There was just enough wind to make the banners [banners - баннеры] that marked the racecourse [racecourse - ипподром] snap [snap - щелчок] and flutter now and then. 

In the silence of the broad [broad - широкий] green meadows one could hear the music winding [winding - обмотка] throughout the city streets, farther and nearer [nearer - ближе] and ever approaching [approaching - приближается], a cheerful [cheerful - жизнерадостный] faint [faint - слабый] sweetness [sweetness - сладость] of the air from time to time trembled [trembled - дрожал] and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells. 

Joyous.

How is one to tell about joy.

How describe the citizens of Omelas.

They were not simple folk [folk - народный], you see, though they were happy.

But we do not say the words of cheer [cheer - радость] much any more.

All smiles have become archaic.

Given a description such as this one tends [tends - стремится] to make certain assumptions [assumptions - предположения]. 

Given a description such as this one tends [tends - стремится] to look next for the King, mounted [mounted - смонтированный] on a splendid stallion and surrounded [surrounded - окруженный] by his noble [noble - благородный] knights, or perhaps in a golden [golden - золотой] litter [litter - мусор] borne by great- muscled slaves.

But there was no king.

They did not use swords [swords - мечи], or keep slaves.

They were not barbarians, I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I suspect [suspect - подозревать] that they were singularly few. 

As they did without monarchy and slavery [slavery - рабство], so they also got on without the stock [stock - запас] exchange,   the advertisement, the secret [secret - секрет] police, and the bomb [bomb - бомбить].

Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk [folk - народный],   not dulcet shepherds, noble [noble - благородный] savages, bland utopians.

There were not less complex [complex - сложный] than us. 

The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid [stupid - глупый].

Only pain [pain - боль] is intellectual [intellectual - интеллектуал], only evil [evil - зло] interesting.

This is the treason of the artist [artist - художник]: a refusal [refusal - отказ] to admit the banality of evil [evil - зло] and the terrible boredom [boredom - скука] of pain [pain - боль].

If you ca n't lick [lick - лизать] 'em, join 'em.

If it hurts, repeat it. 

But to praise [praise - хвалить] despair [despair - отчаяние] is to condemn [condemn - осуждать] delight [delight - восторг], to embrace [embrace - объятие] violence [violence - насилие] is to lose hold of everything else. 

We have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.

How can I tell you about the people of Omelas.

They were not naive [naive - наивный] and happy children-- though their children were, in fact, happy.

They were mature [mature - зрелый], intelligent, passionate [passionate - страстный] adults whose lives were not wretched.

O miracle [miracle - чудо].

But I wish I could describe it better. 

I wish I could convince [convince - убеждать] you.

Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale [tale - сказка],   long ago and far away, once upon a time.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own   fancy bids, assuming [assuming - предполагая] it will rise [rise - рост] to the occasion [occasion - повод], for certainly I can not suit you all. 

For instance [instance - пример], how about technology.

I think that there would be no cars or helicopters [helicopters - вертолеты] in and above the streets;   this follows from the fact that the people of Omelas are happy people. 

Happiness is based [based - основанный на] on a just discrimination [discrimination - дискриминация] of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive [destructive - разрушительный], and what is destructive [destructive - разрушительный].

In the middle category [category - категория], however-- that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort [comfort - комфорт], luxury [luxury - роскошь], exuberance [exuberance - изобилие], etc.-they could   perfectly well have central [central - центральный] heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices [devices - устройства] not yet invented here, floating [floating - плавающий] light- sources, fuelless power, a cure [cure - излечивать] for the common cold.

Or they could have none of that: it does n't matter. 

As you like it.

I incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming   to to Omelas during the last days before the Festival on very fast little trains and double- decked trams,   and that the trains station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though plainer than the magnificent [magnificent - великолепный] Farmers' Market. 

But even granted [granted - предоставленный] trains, I fear [fear - страх] that Omelas so far strikes [strikes - забастовки] some of you as goody- goody. 

Smiles, bells, parades [parades - парады], horses, bleh.

If so, please add an orgy [orgy - оргия].

If an orgy [orgy - оргия] would help, do n't hesitate [hesitate - сомневаться].

Let us not, however, have temples [temples - храмы] from which issue [issue - проблема] beautiful nude priests [priests - священники] and priestesses already half [half - половина] in ecstasy [ecstasy - экстаз] and ready to copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires [desires - желания] union [union - союз] with the deep [deep - глубокий] godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea. 

But really it would be better not to have any temples [temples - храмы] in Omelas-- at least, not manned [manned - пилотируемый] temples [temples - храмы].

Religion [Religion - Религия] yes, clergy no.

Surely [Surely - Конечно] the beautiful nudes can just wander [wander - бродить] about, offering themselves like divine [divine - божественный] souffles to the hunger [hunger - голод] of the needy [needy - нуждающийся] and the rapture of the flesh [flesh - плоть].

Let them join the processions. 

Let tambourines be struck [struck - ударил] above the copulations, and the gory of desire [desire - желание] be proclaimed [proclaimed - провозглашенный] upon the gongs, and( a not unimportant point) let the offspring [offspring - потомство] of these delightful [delightful - восхитительный] rituals [rituals - ритуалы] be beloved and looked after by all.

One thing I know there is none of in Omelas is guilt [guilt - вина].

But what else should there be? 

I thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical.

For those who like it, the faint [faint - слабый]   insistent sweetness [sweetness - сладость] of drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great   lightness and brilliance [brilliance - блеск] to the mind and limbs [limbs - конечности], and then after some hours a dreamy [dreamy - мечтательный] languor, and wonderful visions [visions - видения] at last of the very arcane and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex [sex - секс] beyond all belief [belief - вера]; and it is not habit- forming [forming - формирование].

For more modest [modest - скромный] tastes [tastes - вкусы] I think there ought [ought - должен] to be beer.

What else, what else belongs in the joyous city? 

The sense of victory [victory - победа], surely [surely - конечно], the celebration of courage [courage - храбрость].

But as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers.

The joy built upon successful slaughter [slaughter - бойня] is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial [trivial - тривиальный]. 

A boundless and generous [generous - щедрый] contentment, a magnanimous triumph [triumph - триумф] felt not against some outer [outer - внешний] enemy [enemy - враг] but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls [souls - души] of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world 's summer: This is what swells [swells - набухает] the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the victory [victory - победа] they celebrate is that of life.

I do n't think many of them need to take drooz. 

Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now.

A marvelous smell of cooking goes forth [forth - вперед] from the red and blue tents [tents - палатки] of the provisioners.

The faces of small children are amiably sticky [sticky - липкий]; in the benign [benign - доброкачественный] gray beard [beard - борода] of a man a couple of crumbs [crumbs - крошки] of rich pastry [pastry - выпечка] are entangled.

The youths and girls have mounted [mounted - смонтированный] their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course.

An old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket [basket - корзина], and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair. 

A child of nine or ten sits at the edge [edge - край] of the crowd alone, playing on a wooden flute [flute - флейта].

People pause [pause - Пауза] to listen, and they smile [smile - улыбка], but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases [ceases - прекращается] playing and never sees them, his dark eyes wholly [wholly - полностью] rapt in the sweet, thing magic of the tune.

He finishes, and slowly lowers [lowers - опускает] his hands holding the wooden flute [flute - флейта]. 

As if that little private silence were the signal [signal - сигнал], all at once a trumpet [trumpet - труба] sounds from the pavilion near the starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing.

The horses rear on their slender legs, and some of them neigh in answer. 

Sober- faced, the young riders [riders - всадники] stroke [stroke - гладить] the horses' necks and soothe [soothe - успокаивать] them, whispering [whispering - шепотом].

" Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope...

They begin to form [form - форма] in rank [rank - классифицировать] along the starting line.

The crowds along the racecourse [racecourse - ипподром] are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind.

The Festival of Summer has begun. 

Do you believe.

Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy.

No.

Then let me describe one more thing.

In a basement [basement - подвал] under one of the beautiful public [public - публичный] buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar [cellar - подвал] of one of its spacious [spacious - просторный] private homes, there is a room.

It has one locked [locked - заблокирован] door, and no window. 

A little light seeps in dustily between cracks [cracks - трещины] in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar [cellar - подвал].

In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff [stiff - жесткий], clotted, foul- smelling [smelling - обоняние] heads, stand near a rusty [rusty - ржавый] bucket.

The floor is dirt [dirt - грязь], a little damp [damp - влажный] to the touch, as cellar [cellar - подвал] dirt [dirt - грязь] usually is. 

The room is about three paces [paces - шагов] long and two wide: a mere [mere - всего лишь] broom [broom - метла] closet or disused tool room.

In the room, a child is sitting.

It could be a boy or a girl.

It looks about six, but actually is nearly ten.

It is feeble- minded [minded - мыслящий].

Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect [neglect - пренебрегать].

It picks its nose and occasionally [occasionally - изредка] fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops. 

It is afraid of the mops.

It finds them horrible [horrible - ужасный].

It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still standing there; and the door is locked [locked - заблокирован]; and nobody will come.

The door is always locked [locked - заблокирован]; and nobody ever comes, except that sometimes-- the child has no understanding [understanding - понимание] of time or interval [interval - интервал]-- sometimes the door rattles terribly [terribly - ужасно] and opens, and a person, or several people, are there.

One of them may come in and kick the child to make it stand up.

The others never come close, but peer [peer - вглядеться] in at it with frightened, disgusted [disgusted - отвращение] eyes. 

The food bowl and the water jug [jug - кувшин] are hastily [hastily - на скорую руку] filled, the door is locked [locked - заблокирован]; the eyes disappear. 

The people at the door never say anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can remember sunlight and its mother 's voice, sometimes speaks.

" I will be good," it says.

" Please let me out.

I will be good!

They never answer.

The child used to scream [scream - крик] for help at night, and cry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining," eh- haa, eh- haa," and it speaks less and less often. 

It is so thin there are no calves [calves - телята] to its legs; its belly protrudes; it lives on a half- bowl of corn meal and grease a day.

It is naked [naked - голый].

Its buttocks and thighs [thighs - бедра] are a mass [mass - масса] of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually [continually - постоянно]. 

They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas.

Some of them have come to see it, others are content [content - содержание] merely [merely - просто] to know it is there.

They all know that it has to be there.

Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness [tenderness - нежность] of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom [wisdom - мудрость] of their scholars [scholars - ученые], the skill of their makers, even the abundance [abundance - избыток] of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly [wholly - полностью] on this child 's abominable misery [misery - невзгоды]. 

This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they seem capable [capable - способный] of understanding [understanding - понимание]; and most of those who come to see the child are young people, though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child.

No matter how well the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators [spectators - зрители] are always shocked [shocked - в шоке] and sickened at the sight.

They feel disgust [disgust - отвращение], which they had thought themselves superior [superior - начальство] to. 

They feel anger [anger - злость], outrage [outrage - возмущение], impotence [impotence - импотенция], despite [despite - несмотря на] all the explanations.

They would like to do something for the child.

But there is nothing they can do.

If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed [fed - кормили] and comforted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity [prosperity - процветание] and beauty and delight [delight - восторг] of Omelas would wither [wither - увядать] and be destroyed.

Those are the terms [terms - условия]. 

To exchange [exchange - обмен] all the goodness [goodness - доброта] and grace [grace - милость] of every life in Omelas for that single, small improvement [improvement - улучшение]: to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of happiness of one: that would be to let guilt [guilt - вина] within the walls indeed.

The terms [terms - условия] are strict and absolute [absolute - абсолютный]; there may not even be a kind word spoken to the child.

Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage [rage - ярость], when they have seen the child and faced this terrible paradox [paradox - парадокс]. 

They may brood over it for weeks or years.

But as time goes on they begin to realize that even if the child could be released [released - выпущенный],   it would not get much good of its freedom: a little vague [vague - нечеткий] pleasure of warmth [warmth - тепло] and food, no real doubt, but little more. 

It is too degraded and imbecile to know any real joy.

It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear. 

Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond [respond - отвечать] to humane [humane - гуманный] treatment [treatment - уход].

Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without walls about it to protect [protect - защищать] it, and darkness [darkness - темнота] for its eyes, and its own excrement to sit in. 

Their tears at the bitter [bitter - горький] injustice [injustice - несправедливость] dry when they begin to perceive [perceive - воспринимать] the terrible justice [justice - справедливость] of reality [reality - реальность], and to accept it.

Yet it is their tears and anger [anger - злость], the trying of their generosity [generosity - щедрость] and the acceptance [acceptance - принятие] of their helplessness [helplessness - беспомощность], which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives.

Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible [irresponsible - безответственный] happiness.

They know that they, like the child, are not free.

They know compassion [compassion - сострадание]. 

It is the existence [existence - существование] of the child, and their knowledge of its existence [existence - существование], that makes possible the nobility [nobility - благородство] of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity of their science.

It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. 

They know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the flute [flute - флейта]- player, could make no joyful music as the young riders [riders - всадники] line [line - линия] up in their beauty for the race [race - раса] in the sunlight of the first morning of summer. 

Now do you believe them.

Are they not more credible [credible - заслуживающий доверия].

But there is one more thing to tell, and this is quite incredible [incredible - невероятный].

At times one of the adolescent [adolescent - подросток] girls or boys who go see the child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all. 

Sometimes also a man or a woman much older falls silent [silent - тихий] for a day or two, then leaves home.

These people go out into the street, and walk down the street alone.

They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the beautiful gates.

They keep walking across the farmlands [farmlands - сельскохозяйственные угодья] of Omelas.

Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman. 

Night falls; the traveler [traveler - путешественник] must pass down village streets, between the houses with yellow- lit windows, and on out into the darkness [darkness - темнота] of the fields.

Each alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains.

They go on.

They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness [darkness - темнота], and they do not come back. 

The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness.

I can not describe it at all.

It is possible that it does not exist.

But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.
