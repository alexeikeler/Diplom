The Ones Who Walk Away  [walk away - іти геть] From Omelas

With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, [swallows soaring - ластівки ширяють]  the Festival of Summer came  [summer came - прийшло літо] to the city Omelas, [city omelas - міські омеляни]  bright-towered by the sea. The ringing of the boats in harbor sparkled  [harbor sparkled - гавань виблискувала] with flags. In the streets between houses with red roofs  [red roofs - червоні дахи] and painted walls, [painted walls - пофарбовані стіни]  between old moss- [old moss - старий мох] grown  gardens and under avenues of trees, past great parks  [past great parks - повз чудові парки] and public buildings, [public buildings - громадські будівлі]  processions moved. [processions moved - рушили процесії] 

Some were decorous: old people  [old people - літні люди] in long stiff robes  [long stiff robes - довгі жорсткі халати] of mauve and gray, grave master workmen, [grave master workmen - могила майстрів]  quiet, merry women carrying  [merry women carrying - веселі жінки несуть] their babies and chatting as they walked. In other streets the music beat faster, [music beat faster - музика заграла швидше]  a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, [people went dancing - люди пішли танцювати]  the procession was a dance. Children dodged  [children dodged - діти ухилялися] in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights  [crossing flights - схрещування рейсів] over the music and the singing. 

All the processions wound towards  [processions wound towards - процесії звивалися назустріч] the north side  [north side - північна сторона] of the city, where on the great water- [great water - велика вода] meadow called  [meadow called - луг зв] the Green Fields boys  [green fields boys - зелені поля хлопчики] and girls, naked in the bright air, [bright air - яскраве повітря]  with mud-stained feet  [stained feet - заплямовані ноги] and ankles and long, lithe arms, [lithe arms - гнучкі руки] exercised their restive horses  [restive horses - неспокійні коні] before the race. 

In the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding throughout  [music winding throughout - музика лунає всюди] the city streets, [city streets - вулиці міста]  farther and nearer and ever approaching, [ever approaching - постійно наближається]  a cheerful faint sweetness  [cheerful faint sweetness - веселий слабка солодкість] of the air from time to time trembled  [time trembled - час тремтів] and gathered together  [gathered together - зібралися разом] and broke out into the great joyous clanging  [great joyous clanging - великий радісний дзвін] of the bells.

Joyous! How is one to tell about joy? How describe the citizens of Omelas? They were not simple folk, [simple folk - простий народ]  you see, though they were happy. But we do not say the words of cheer much  [cheer much - бадьорити багато] any more. All smiles have become archaic. [become archaic - стають архаїчними]  Given a description such as this one tends  [one tends - один прагне] to make certain assumptions. [make certain assumptions - зробити певні припущення]  

Given a description such as this one tends  [one tends - один прагне] to look next  [look next - дивіться далі] for the King, mounted on a splendid stallion  [splendid stallion - шикарний жеребець] and surrounded by his noble knights, [noble knights - благородні лицарі]  or perhaps in a golden litter borne  [golden litter borne - золотий послід несли] by great-muscled slaves. [muscled slaves - мускулисті раби]  But there was no king. They did not use swords, [use swords - використовувати мечі]  or keep slaves. [keep slaves - тримати рабів]  They were not barbarians, I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I suspect that they were singularly few. 

As they did without monarchy  [without monarchy - без монархії] and slavery, so they also got  [also got - також отримав] on without the stock exchange, [stock exchange - Фондова біржа]   the advertisement, the secret police, [secret police - таємна поліція]  and the bomb. Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk, [simple folk - простий народ]   not dulcet shepherds, [dulcet shepherds - солодкі пастухи]  noble savages, [noble savages - шляхетні дикуни]  bland utopians. [bland utopians - м'які утопісти]  There were not less complex  [less complex - менш складний] than us.

But to praise despair  [praise despair - хвалити розпач] is to condemn delight, [condemn delight - засуджувати захоплення]  to embrace violence  [embrace violence - приймати насильство] is to lose hold  [lose hold - втратити владу] of everything else. [everything else - все інше]   We have almost lost hold; [almost lost hold - майже втратив утримання]  we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. How can I tell you about the people of Omelas? They were not naive and happy children--though their children were, in fact, happy. They were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose lives were not wretched. O miracle! But I wish I could describe  [could describe - міг описати] it better. 

I wish I could convince  [could convince - міг переконати] you. Omelas sounds  [omelas sounds - звучить омелас] in my words like  [words like - такі слова, як] a city in a fairy tale, [fairy tale - казка]   long ago  [long ago - давно] and far away, [far away - далеко]  once upon a time. Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own  fancy bids, [fancy bids - фантастичні ставки]  assuming it will rise to the occasion,for certainly I cannot suit  [cannot suit - не може підійти] you all.  For instance, how about technology? I think that there would be no cars or helicopters in and above the streets;  this follows from the fact that the people of Omelas are happy people. [happy people - щасливі люди]  

Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary  [neither necessary - не потрібно] nor destructive, and what is destructive. In the middle category, [middle category - середня категорія]  however--that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, etc.-they could  perfectly well have central heating, [central heating - Центральне опалення]  subway trains, [subway trains - поїзди метро]  washing machines, [washing machines - пральні машини]  and all kinds of marvelous devices  [marvelous devices - чудові пристрої] not yet invented  [yet invented - ще винайшли] here, floating light- [floating light - плаваюче світло] sources, fuelless power, [fuelless power - безпаливна потужність]  a cure for the common cold. [common cold - застуда]  Or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter. 

But even granted trains, [even granted trains - навіть надані поїзди]  I fear that Omelas so far strikes  [far strikes - далеких ударів] some of you as goody-goody.  Smiles, bells, parades, horses, bleh. If so, please add  [please add - будь ласка, додайте] an orgy. If an orgy would help, [orgy would help - оргія допоможе]  don't hesitate. Let us  [let us - дозвольте нам] not, however, have temples from which issue beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half  [priestesses already half - жриці вже наполовину] in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires union  [desires union - бажає союзу] with the deep godhead  [deep godhead - глибоке божество] of the blood, although that was my first idea. [first idea - перша ідея]  

But really it would be better not to have any temples in Omelas--at least, not manned temples. [manned temples - укомплектовані храми]  Religion yes, [religion yes - релігія так]  clergy no. Surely the beautiful nudes  [beautiful nudes - красиві ню] can just wander about, offering themselves like divine souffles  [like divine souffles - як божественне суфле] to the hunger of the needy and the rapture of the flesh. Let them join the processions. 

Let tambourines  [let tambourines - пускай бубни] be struck above the copulations, and the gory of desire be proclaimed upon  [proclaimed upon - проголошено на] the gongs, and (a not unimportant point) [unimportant point - неважливий момент]  let the offspring of these delightful rituals  [delightful rituals - приємні ритуали] be beloved and looked after by all. One thing  [one thing - одна річ] I know there is none of in Omelas is guilt. But what else should there be? 

I thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical. For those who like it, the faint  insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume  [drooz may perfume - drooz може парфумувати] the ways of the city, drooz which first brings  [first brings - перший приносить] a great  lightness and brilliance to the mind and limbs, and then after some hours a dreamy languor, [dreamy languor - мрійлива млявість]  and wonderful visions  [wonderful visions - чудові бачення] at last of the very arcane and inmost secrets  [inmost secrets - найпотаємніші таємниці] of the Universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex beyond  [sex beyond - секс поза межами] all belief; and it is not habit-forming. For more modest tastes  [modest tastes - скромні смаки] I think there ought to be beer. What else, what else belongs  [else belongs - інше належить] in the joyous city? [joyous city - радісне місто]  

The sense of victory, surely, the celebration of courage. But as we did without clergy, [without clergy - без духовенства]  let us  [let us - дозвольте нам] do without soldiers. [without soldiers - без солдатів]  The joy built upon successful slaughter is not the right kind  [right kind - правильний вид] of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. 

Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields  [green fields - зелені поля] by now. A marvelous smell  [marvelous smell - чудовий запах] of cooking goes forth  [cooking goes forth - приготування йде далі] from the red and blue tents  [blue tents - сині намети] of the provisioners. The faces of small children  [small children - маленькі діти] are amiably sticky; [amiably sticky - привітно липкий]  in the benign gray beard  [benign gray beard - доброякісна сива борода] of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry  [rich pastry - здобне тісто] are entangled. The youths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group around  [group around - групуватися навколо] the starting line  [starting line - стартова лінія] of the course. An old woman, [old woman - стара жінка]  small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair. [shining hair - сяюче волосся]  

A child of nine or ten sits  [ten sits - десять сидить] at the edge of the crowd alone, [crowd alone - натовп один]  playing on a wooden flute. [wooden flute - дерев'яна флейта]  People pause  [people pause - люди роблять паузу] to listen, and they smile, but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases playing  [never ceases playing - ніколи не перестає грати] and never sees  [never sees - ніколи не бачить] them, his dark eyes wholly rapt in the sweet, thing magic  [thing magic - річ магія] of the tune. He finishes, and slowly lowers  [slowly lowers - повільно опускається] his hands holding  [hands holding - руки тримають] the wooden flute.

As if that little private silence  [little private silence - маленька приватна тиша] were the signal, all at once a trumpet sounds  [trumpet sounds - звуки труби] from the pavilion near  [pavilion near - павільйон біля] the starting line: [starting line - стартова лінія]  imperious, melancholy, piercing. The horses rear  [horses rear - коні задні] on their slender legs, [slender legs - стрункі ніжки]  and some of them neigh in answer. 

Sober-faced, the young riders stroke  [young riders stroke - молоді вершники обведення] the horses' necks and soothe them, whispering. "Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope..." They begin to form in rank along  [rank along - ранг уздовж] the starting line. [starting line - стартова лінія]  The crowds along  [crowds along - натовпи вздовж] the racecourse are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind. The Festival of Summer has begun.

A little light seeps  [little light seeps - просочується мало світла] in dustily between cracks in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar. In one corner  [one corner - один кут] of the little room  [little room - кімнатка] a couple of mops, with stiff, clotted, foul-smelling heads, [smelling heads - пахнуть голови]  stand near  [stand near - стояти поруч] a rusty bucket. [rusty bucket - іржаве відро]  The floor is dirt, a little damp  [little damp - трохи вологі] to the touch, as cellar dirt usually  [cellar dirt usually - бруд підвалу зазвичай] is.

The room is about three paces long  [three paces long - завдовжки три кроки] and two wide: [two wide - дві широкі]  a mere broom closet  [mere broom closet - проста шафа для мітли] or disused tool room. [disused tool room - невикористовувана інструментальна кімната]  In the room, a child is sitting. It could be a boy or a girl. It looks about six, but actually is nearly ten. [nearly ten - майже десять]  It is feeble-minded. Perhaps it was born defective, [born defective - народжений дефектним]  or perhaps it has become imbecile  [become imbecile - стати недоумком] through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. It picks its nose and occasionally fumbles vaguely  [occasionally fumbles vaguely - час від часу невиразно мацає] with its toes or genitals, as it sits hunched  [sits hunched - сидить згорбившись] in the corner farthest  [corner farthest - найдальший кут] from the bucket and the two mops. [two mops - дві швабри]  

It is afraid of the mops. It finds them horrible. It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still standing  [still standing - все ще стоїть] there; and the door is locked; and nobody will come. The door is always locked; [always locked - завжди заблокований]  and nobody ever comes, [nobody ever comes - ніхто ніколи не приходить]  except that sometimes--the child has no understanding of time or interval--sometimes the door rattles terribly  [door rattles terribly - двері страшно гримлять] and opens, and a person, or several people, [several people - декілька людей]  are there. One of them may come  [may come - може прийти] in and kick the child to make it stand up. The others never come close, but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. [disgusted eyes - огидні очі]  

They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are content merely  [content merely - лише вміст] to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers  [kindly weathers - ласкаво вивітрює] of their skies, depend wholly  [depend wholly - цілком залежать] on this child's abominable misery. [abominable misery - огидна біда] 

This is usually explained  [usually explained - зазвичай пояснюється] to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they seem capable  [seem capable - здається здатним] of understanding; and most of those who come to see the child are young people, [young people - Молоді люди]  though often enough  [though often enough - хоча досить часто] an adult comes, [adult comes - приходить дорослий]  or comes back, [comes back - повертається]  to see the child. No matter how well the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators  [young spectators - юних глядачів] are always shocked  [always shocked - завжди в шоці] and sickened at the sight. They feel disgust, [feel disgust - відчувати огиду]  which they had thought themselves superior to. 

They feel anger, [feel anger - відчувати гнів]  outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations. They would like  [would like - хотів би] to do something for the child. But there is nothing they can do. If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, [vile place - мерзенне місце]  if it were cleaned and fed and comforted, that would be a good thing, [good thing - Гарна річ]  indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of Omelas would wither  [omelas would wither - омелас зів'яв би] and be destroyed. Those are the terms. 

To exchange all the goodness and grace of every life  [every life - кожне життя] in Omelas for that single, small improvement: [small improvement - невелике покращення]  to throw away  [throw away - викинути] the happiness of thousands for the chance of happiness of one: that would be to let guilt within  [let guilt within - нехай провина всередині] the walls indeed. [walls indeed - дійсно стіни]  The terms are strict and absolute; there may not even be a kind word spoken  [kind word spoken - сказане добре слово] to the child. Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, [tearless rage - безслізна лють]  when they have seen the child and faced this terrible paradox. [terrible paradox - жахливий парадокс]  

Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment. [humane treatment - гуманне ставлення]  Indeed, after so long it would probably  [would probably - напевно] be wretched without walls  [wretched without walls - жалюгідний без стін] about it to protect it, and darkness for its eyes, and its own excrement to sit in.

Their tears at the bitter injustice dry  [bitter injustice dry - гірка несправедливість суха] when they begin to perceive the terrible justice  [terrible justice - страшне правосуддя] of reality, and to accept it. Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source  [true source - справжнє джерело] of the splendor of their lives. Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness. [irresponsible happiness - безвідповідальне щастя]  They know that they, like the child, are not free. They know compassion. [know compassion - знати співчуття]  

It is the existence of the child, and their knowledge of its existence, that makes possible  [makes possible - робить можливим] the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity of their science. It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children. 

They know that if the wretched one  [wretched one - нещасний] were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the flute-player, could make  [could make - міг зробити] no joyful music  [joyful music - радісна музика] as the young riders line  [young riders line - лінія молодих вершників] up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first morning  [first morning - перший ранок] of summer.

Now do you believe them? Are they not more credible? But there is one more thing to tell, and this is quite incredible. [quite incredible - зовсім неймовірно]  At times one  [times one - раз один] of the adolescent girls  [adolescent girls - дівчаток-підлітків] or boys who go see  [go see - піди подивись] the child does not go home  [go home - Іди додому] to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all.  Sometimes also  [sometimes also - іноді також] a man or a woman much older falls silent for a day or two, then leaves home. [leaves home - йде з дому]  These people go  [people go - люди йдуть] out into the street, and walk down the street alone. [street alone - вулиця одна]  They keep walking, [keep walking - продовжуй йти]  and walk straight  [walk straight - ходити прямо] out of the city of Omelas, through the beautiful gates. [beautiful gates - красиві ворота]  They keep walking across  [keep walking across - продовжуйте йти поперек] the farmlands of Omelas. Each one goes alone, [one goes alone - один йде сам]  youth or girl, man or woman.

The place they go towards  [go towards - йти назустріч] is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe  [cannot describe - не можу описати] it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away  [walk away - іти геть] from Omelas.
