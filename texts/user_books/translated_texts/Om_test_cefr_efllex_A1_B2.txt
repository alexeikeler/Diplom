 With a clamor of bells  [bells - колокола] that set  [set - набор] the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came  [came - пришел] to the city  [city - город] Omelas, bright-towered by the sea. [sea - море] 

The ringing of the boats  [boats - лодки] in harbor sparkled with flags. [flags - флаги] 

Some were decorous: old  [old - старые] people  [people - люди] in long  [long - длинные] stiff  [stiff - жесткие] robes of mauve and gray, grave master  [master - хозяева] workmen, [workmen - рабочие]  quiet, [quiet - тихие]  merry  [merry - веселые] women  [women - бабы] carrying  [carrying - несущие] their babies  [babies - младенцев] and chatting as they walked. [walked - гуляли] 

Children  [Children - Дети] dodged in and out, their high  [high - высокие] calls  [calls - звонки] rising like  [like - нравится] the swallows' crossing flights over the music  [music - музыка] and the singing.   

The horses  [horses - лошади] wore  [wore - носил] no gear at all but a halter without bit.

Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green. [green - зеленый] 

They flared their nostrils  [nostrils - ноздри] and pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly excited, [excited - возбужденный]  the horse  [horse - лошадь] being the only animal  [animal - животное] who has adopted our ceremonies as his own.   

Far off to the north and west the mountains  [mountains - горы] stood up half  [half - половина] encircling Omelas on her bay.

There was just enough wind  [wind - ветер] to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then.   

In the silence of the broad green  [green - зеленый] meadows one could hear  [hear - слышу] the music  [music - музыку] winding  [winding - извилистый] throughout the city  [city - город] streets, [streets - улицы]  farther and nearer and ever approaching, [approaching - приближается]  a cheerful faint sweetness of the air from time  [time - время]  [time - время] to time trembled and gathered together and broke  [broke - сломал] out into the great  [great - великий] joyous clanging of the bells. [bells - колокола]
