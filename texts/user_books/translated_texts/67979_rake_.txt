 THE BLUE CASTLE [blue castle - голубой замок] 



 CHAPTER I

 If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole life would  [whole life would - вся жизнь будет] have been entirely different. [entirely different - совершенно другое]  She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s engagement picnic  [engagement picnic - пикник на помолвку] and Dr. Trent would  [trent would - трент будет] have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear  [shall hear - услышать] what happened to her because of it.

Valancy wakened early, [valancy wakened early - валэнси проснулась рано]  in the lifeless, hopeless hour  [hopeless hour - безнадежный час] just preceding dawn. [preceding dawn - предшествующий рассвет]  She had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, [sleep well - спать хорошо]  sometimes, when one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community and connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to get a man.

Deerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless old maidenhood. [hopeless old maidenhood - безнадежное старое девственность]  But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished  [never quite relinquished - никогда не отказываюсь от] a certain pitiful, [certain pitiful - определенно жалко]  shamed, little hope  [little hope - маленькая надежда] that Romance would come  [romance would come - романтика придет] her way yet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, [horrible morning - ужасное утро]  when she wakened to the fact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.

Ay, _there_ lay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old maid. [old maid - старая дева]  After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as dreadful as being married to an Uncle Wellington  [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон] or an Uncle Benjamin, [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин]  or even an Uncle Herbert. [uncle herbert - дядя герберт]  What hurt her was that she had never had a chance to be anything but an old maid. No man had ever desired  [ever desired - всегда желанная] her.

The tears came  [tears came - слезы навернулись] into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly greying darkness. [faintly greying darkness - слабо сереющей темноты]  She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two reasons. [two reasons - две причины]  She was afraid that crying might bring  [crying might bring - плач может вызвать] on another attack  [another attack - еще одна атака] of that pain around  [pain around - боль вокруг] the heart. She had had a spell of it after she had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was afraid her mother would notice  [mother would notice - мать заметит] her red eyes  [red eyes - красные глаза ] at breakfast and keep at her with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding  [like questions regarding - как вопросы относительно] the cause thereof. [cause thereof - причина этого] 

“Suppose,” thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, [ghastly grin - ужасная ухмылка]  “I answered with the plain truth, [plain truth - простая правда]  ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ How horrified Mother would  [horrified mother would - в ужасе мать будет] be—though she is ashamed every day  [ashamed every day - стыдно каждый день] of her life of her old maid daughter.”

But of course appearances  [course appearances - виды курса] should be kept up. “It is not,” Valancy could hear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, [dictatorial voice asserting - диктаторский голос, утверждающий]  “it is not _maidenly_ to think about _men_.”

The thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a sense of humour nobody  [humour nobody - юмор никто] in her clan suspected. [clan suspected - клан не подозревал]  For that matter, there were a good many things  [good many things - много всего] about Valancy that nobody suspected. [nobody suspected - никто не подозревал]  But her laughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled, futile little figure, [futile little figure - бесполезная маленькая фигурка]  listening to the rain pouring  [rain pouring - дождь льется] down outside and watching, with a sick distaste, [sick distaste - больное отвращение]  the chill, merciless light creeping  [merciless light creeping - беспощадный свет ползет] into her ugly, sordid room. [sordid room - грязная комната] 

She knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. The yellow-painted floor, [painted floor - раскрашенный пол]  with one hideous, [one hideous - один отвратительный]  “hooked” rug by the bed, with a grotesque, “hooked” dog on it, always grinning  [always grinning - всегда улыбается] at her when she awoke; the faded, dark-red paper; [red paper - красная бумага]  the ceiling discoloured  [ceiling discoloured - обесцвеченный потолок] by old leaks  [old leaks - старые утечки] and crossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; [pinched little washstand - ужала маленький умывальник]  the brown-paper lambrequin  [paper lambrequin - бумажный ламбрекен] with purple roses  [purple roses - фиолетовый розы] on it; the spotted old looking- [spotted old looking - пятнистый старый вид] glass with the crack across  [crack across - трещина поперек] it, propped up on the inadequate dressing- [inadequate dressing - неподходящая одежда] table; the jar of ancient potpourri made  [ancient potpourri made - старинное попурри сделано] by her mother in her mythical honeymoon; [mythical honeymoon - мифический медовый месяц]  the shell-covered box, [covered box - закрытая коробка]  with one burst corner, [one burst corner - один лопнувший угол]  which Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - кузен застрял] had made in her equally mythical girlhood; [equally mythical girlhood - такое же мифическое девичество ]  the beaded pincushion  [beaded pincushion - подушечка для иголок из бисера] with half its bead fringe gone; [bead fringe gone - бахрома из бисера исчезла]  the one stiff, [one stiff - один жесткий]  yellow chair; [yellow chair - желтый стул]  the faded old motto, [faded old motto - выцветший старый девиз]  “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns  [coloured yarns - цветные нити] about Great-grand-mother Stirling’s grim old face; [grim old face - угрюмое старое лицо]  the old photographs  [old photographs - старые фотографии] of ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were only two pictures  [two pictures - две фотографии] that were not of relatives. One, an old chromo  [old chromo - старый хром] of a puppy sitting  [puppy sitting - сидение щенка] on a rainy doorstep. [rainy doorstep - дождливый порог]  That picture always made Valancy unhappy. That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep in the driving rain! [driving rain - проливной дождь]  Why didn’t _some one_ open the door and let him in? The other picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving  [partouted engraving - разорванная гравюра] of Queen Louise coming  [queen louise coming - приходит королева луиза] down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington  [aunt wellington - тетя веллингтон] had lavishly given  [lavishly given - щедро дано] her on her tenth birthday. [tenth birthday - десятый день рождения]  For nineteen years  [nineteen years - девятнадцать лет] she had looked at it and hated it, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. [satisfied queen louise - удовлетворенная королева луиза]  But she never dared destroy  [never dared destroy - никогда не осмеливалась разрушить] it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would  [cousin stickles would - двоюродный брат застрял бы] have been aghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed  [valancy irreverently expressed - валентность непочтительно выражена] it in her thoughts, would have had a fit.

Every room  [every room - каждая комната] in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances  [downstairs appearances - выступления внизу] were kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw. Valancy sometimes felt  [valancy sometimes felt - валанти иногда чувствуется ] that she could have done something  [done something - что-то делала] for her room herself, even without money, [even without money - даже без денег]  if she were permitted. But her mother had negatived every timid suggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy never persisted. [valancy never persisted - валэнси никогда не настаивала]  She was afraid to. Her mother could  [mother could - мать могла] not brook opposition. [brook opposition - терпела сопротивление]  Mrs. Stirling would sulk  [stirling would sulk - стирлинг дулся] for days if offended, with the airs of an insulted duchess. [insulted duchess - оскорбляла герцогиню] 

The only thing Valancy liked  [thing valancy liked - вещь, которую любила вэлэнси] about her room was that she could be alone there at night to cry if she wanted to.

But, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for nothing except sleeping  [nothing except sleeping - ничего, кроме сна] and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never permitted  [never permitted - никогда разрешено] to stay alone  [stay alone - оставаться в одиночестве] in her room for any other purpose. People who wanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling  [frederick stirling - фредерик стирлинг] and Cousin Stickles believed, [cousin stickles believed - двоюродный брат Стиклз верил]  could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose. [sinister purpose - зловещая цель]  But her room in the Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] was everything a room should be.

For one thing  [one thing - одна вещь] she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time. One who wooed her with all the romantic ardour  [romantic ardour - романтический пыл] of the age of chivalry and won her after long devotion  [long devotion - долгая преданность] and many deeds  [many deeds - много подвигов] of derring-do, and was wedded to her with pomp and circumstance in the great, banner-hung chapel  [hung chapel - висящая часовня] of the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок] 

At twelve, this lover was a fair lad  [fair lad - светлый парень] with golden curls  [golden curls - золотые кудри] and heavenly blue eyes. [heavenly blue eyes - небесно-голубые глаза]  At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still necessarily handsome. [still necessarily handsome - все еще обязательно красивый]  At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At twenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, [cut jaw - разрезанная челюсть]  slightly grim, [slightly grim - слегка мрачный]  and a face strong  [face strong -  лицо сильное] and rugged rather  [rugged rather - суровый довольно] than handsome. Valancy never grew older than twenty-five in her Blue Castle, [blue castle - голубой замок]  but recently—very recently—her hero had had reddish, tawny hair, [tawny hair - каштановые волосы]  a twisted smile  [twisted smile - кривая улыбка] and a mysterious past. [mysterious past - таинственное прошлое] 

I don’t say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew them. One simply faded away as another came. [another came - еще один пришел]  Things are very convenient in this respect in Blue Castles. [blue castles - голубые замки] 

But, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could  [valancy could - валэнси могла] not find the key of her Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  Reality pressed  [reality pressed - реальность давила] on her too hardly, barking at her heels like  [heels like -  каблуки как] a maddening little dog. [maddening little dog - сводящая с ума маленькая собачка]  She was twenty-nine, lonely, undesired, ill-favoured—the only homely girl  [homely girl - некрасивая девочка] in a handsome clan, [handsome clan - красивый клан]  with no past and no future. As far as she could look back, [could look back - могла оглянуться назад]  life was drab and colourless, with not one single crimson  [one single crimson - один-единственный малиновый] or purple spot anywhere. [purple spot anywhere - пурпурное пятно где угодно]  As far as she could look forward  [could look forward - могла смотреть вперед] it seemed certain  [seemed certain - казалось уверенной] to be just the same until she was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging to a wintry bough. [wintry bough - зимняя ветка]  The moment when a woman realises  [woman realises - женщина понимает] that she has nothing to live for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the bitterness of death.

“And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop. I may have to live eighty years,” thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. “We’re all horribly long- [horribly long - ужасно долго] lived. It sickens me to think of it.”

She was glad it was raining—or rather, she was drearily satisfied  [drearily satisfied - тоскливо доволен] that it was raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic, [annual picnic - ежегодный пикник]  whereby Aunt  [whereby aunt - в котором тете] and Uncle Wellington—one always thought of them in that succession—inevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty years  [picnic thirty years - пикник тридцати лет] before, had been, of late years, [late years - поздние годы]  a veritable nightmare  [veritable nightmare - настоящий кошмар] to Valancy. By an impish coincidence  [impish coincidence - озорное совпадение] it was the same day as her birthday and, after she had passed twenty- [passed twenty - перевалило за двадцать] five, nobody let  [nobody let - никто не позволил] her forget it.

Much as she hated going  [hated going - ненавидел ходить] to the picnic, it would never  [would never - никогда] have occurred to her to rebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the revolutionary in her nature. And she knew exactly  [knew exactly - знал точно] what every one would say to her at the picnic. Uncle Wellington, [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон]  whom she disliked and despised even though  [despised even though - презирать, хотя] he had fulfilled the highest Stirling aspiration, [highest stirling aspiration - наивысшее устремление стирлинга]  “marrying money,” would say to her in a pig’s whisper, “Not thinking of getting married yet, [getting married yet - выйти замуж еще]  my dear?” and then go off into the bellow of laughter with which he invariably concluded  [invariably concluded - неизменно заключал] his dull remarks. [dull remarks - скучные замечания]  Aunt Wellington, [aunt wellington - тетя веллингтон]  of whom Valancy stood  [valancy stood - вэлэнси стояла] in abject awe, [abject awe - презренный трепет ]  would tell  [would tell - сказать] her about Olive’s new chiffon dress  [new chiffon dress - новое шифоновое платье] and Cecil’s last devoted letter. [last devoted letter - последний преданный письмо]  Valancy would  [valancy would - вэланси бы] have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter had been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. And Valancy had long ago decided  [long ago decided - давно решил] that she would rather offend God than Aunt Wellington, because God might forgive  [god might forgive - бог мог бы простить] her but Aunt Wellington never would.

Aunt Alberta, [aunt alberta - тетя альберта]  enormously fat, [enormously fat - невероятно толстая]  with an amiable habit  [amiable habit - любезная привычка] of always referring  [always referring - всегда ссылалась] to her husband as “he,” as if he were the only male creature  [male creature - мужское существо] in the world, who could never forget  [could never forget - никогда не мог забыть] that she had been a great beauty  [great beauty - невероятная красота] in her youth, would condole  [would condole - сочувствовал бы] with Valancy on her sallow skin—

“I don’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When _I_ was a girl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl  [prettiest girl - самая красивая девушка] in Canada, my dear.”

Perhaps Uncle Herbert  [perhaps uncle herbert - возможно, дядя Герберт] wouldn’t say anything—or perhaps he would remark jocularly, [would remark jocularly - заметил бы в шутку]  “How fat you’re getting, Doss!” And then everybody would laugh  [everybody would laugh - все бы смеялись] over the excessively humorous idea  [excessively humorous idea - чрезмерно юмористическая идея] of poor, scrawny little Doss getting fat.

Handsome, solemn Uncle James, [solemn uncle james - торжественный дядя джеймс]  whom Valancy disliked  [valancy disliked - валэнси не любил] but respected because he was reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan oracle—brains being none too plentiful in the Stirling connection—would probably remark with the owl-like sarcasm  [like sarcasm - люблю сарказм] that had won him his reputation, “I suppose you’re busy with your hope-chest these days?”

And Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, [abominable conundrums - отвратительные загадки]  between wheezy chuckles, [wheezy chuckles - хриплое хихиканье]  and answer them himself.

“What is the difference between Doss and a mouse?

“The mouse wishes  [mouse wishes - мышиные желания] to harm the cheese and Doss wishes  [doss wishes - дохлые желания] to charm the he’s.”

Valancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times  [riddle fifty times - загадки пятьдесят раз] and every time  [every time - каждый время] she wanted to throw something  [throw something - бросал что-то] at him. But she never did. In the first place, [first place - первое место]  the Stirlings simply  [stirlings simply - стирлинги просто] did not throw things; [throw things - бросал вещи]  in the second place, [second place - второе место]  Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] was a wealthy and childless old widower  [childless old widower - бездетный старый вдовец] and Valancy had been brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she offended him he would cut  [would cut - вырезал бы] her out of his will—supposing she were in it. Valancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin’s will. She had been poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness  [galling bitterness - раздражающая горечь] of it. So she endured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them.

Aunt Isabel, [aunt isabel - тетя изабель]  downright and disagreeable as an east wind, [east wind - восточный ветер]  would criticise  [would criticise - будут критиковать] her in some way—Valancy could not predict just how, for Aunt Isabel never repeated a criticism—she found something new  [found something new - нашла что-то новое] with which to jab you every time. [every time - каждый раз]  Aunt Isabel prided  [aunt isabel prided - тетя изабель гордится] herself on saying what she thought, but didn’t like it so well when other people said  [people said - люди говорили] what _they_ thought to _her_. Valancy never said  [valancy never said - валэнси никогда не говорила] what _she_ thought.

Cousin Georgiana—named after her great-great-grand-mother, who had been named after George the Fourth—would recount dolorously the names of all relatives and friends who had died since  [died since - умер с тех пор] the last picnic  [last picnic - последний пикник] and wonder “w [wonder “ - удивляться «] hich of us will be the first to go next.”

Oppressively competent, [oppressively competent - депрессивно компетентный]  Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her husband and her odious prodigies  [odious prodigies - одиозные вундеркинды] of babies to Valancy, because Valancy would  [valancy would - валэнси бы] be the only one she could find  [could find - могла найти] to put up with it. For the same reason, Cousin Gladys—really First Cousin Gladys once removed, according to the strict way  [strict way - строгий образ] in which the Stirlings tabulated relationship—a tall, thin lady  [thin lady - худая дама] who admitted she had a sensitive disposition, [sensitive disposition - чуткий нрав]  would describe minutely  [would describe minutely - описала бы подробно] the tortures of her neuritis. And Olive, the wonder girl  [wonder girl - удивилась бы девушка] of the whole Stirling clan, [whole stirling clan - весь клан стирлингов]  who had everything Valancy  [everything valancy - все валентность] had not—beauty, popularity, love,—would show off her beauty and presume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia  [diamond insignia - алмазные знаки отличия] of love in Valancy’s dazzled, envious eyes. [envious eyes - завистливые глаза] 

There would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up of teaspoons. The packing up was always left  [always left -  всегда оставался] for Valancy and Cousin Stickles. [cousin stickles - двоюродная палочка]  And once, six years ago, [six years ago - шесть лет назад]  a silver teaspoon  [silver teaspoon - серебряная чайная ложка] from Aunt Wellington’s wedding set  [wedding set - свадебный набор] had been lost. Valancy never heard  [valancy never heard - валанси никогда не слышала] the last of that silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo- [ghost appeared banquo - призрак явился банко] like at every subsequent family feast.

Since there would be no picnic, Valancy made  [valancy made - валэнси сделал] up her mind that, if the rain held  [rain held - дождь прошел] up in the afternoon, she would go  [would go - пойдет] up to the library and get another  [get another - получить еще один] of John Foster’s books. Valancy was never allowed  [never allowed - никогда не разрешал] to read novels, [read novels - читал романы]  but John Foster’s books were not novels. They were “nature books”—so the librarian told Mrs. [librarian told mrs - библиотекарь сказал миссис]  Frederick Stirling—“all about the woods and birds and bugs and things like  [things like - вещи типа] that, you know.” So Valancy was allowed to read them—under protest, for it was only too evident that she enjoyed them too much. It was permissible, even laudable, [even laudable -  даже похвально]  to read to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was enjoyable was dangerous. Valancy did not know whether  [know whether - знаю ли] her mind was being improved or not; but she felt vaguely  [felt vaguely - почувствовал смутно] that if she had come across John Foster’s books years ago life might have been a different thing  [different thing - другая вещь] for her. They seemed to her to yield glimpses  [yield glimpses - выдает проблески] of a world into which she might once have entered, though the door was forever barred  [forever barred - навсегда запрет] to her now. It was only within the last year  [last year - в прошлом году] that John Foster’s books had been in the Deerwood library, [deerwood library - библиотека из оленьего дерева]  though the librarian told Valancy  [librarian told valancy - библиотекарь сказал вэланси] that he had been a well-known writer  [known writer - известный писатель] for several years. [several years - несколько лет] 

“Where does he live?” Valancy had asked.

“Nobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more information can be had. His publishers won’t say a word. Quite likely John Foster is a nom de plume. [nom de plume - псевдоним]  His books are so popular we can’t keep them in at all, though I really can’t see what people find  [people find - люди находят] in them to rave over.”

“I think they’re wonderful,” said Valancy, timidly.

“Oh—well—” Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion  [patronising fashion - покровительственное отношение к моде] that relegated Valancy’s opinions to limbo, “I can’t say I care much  [care much - много заботы] for bugs myself. But certainly Foster seems  [certainly foster seems - определенно, приемные кажутся] to know all there is to know about them.”

Valancy didn’t know whether  [know whether - знают ли] she cared much  [cared much - много заботился] for bugs either. [bugs either - о жуках]  It was not John Foster’s uncanny knowledge  [uncanny knowledge - сверхъестественное знание] of wild creatures  [wild creatures - дикие существа] and insect life  [insect life - жизнь насекомых] that enthralled her. She could hardly say  [could hardly say - едва ли могу сказать] what it was—some tantalising lure  [tantalising lure - манящая приманка] of a mystery never revealed—some hint of a great secret  [great secret - великий секрет] just a little further on—some faint, elusive echo  [elusive echo - неуловимое эхо ] of lovely, forgotten things—John Foster’s magic was indefinable.

Yes, she would get  [would get - получит] a new Foster book. [new foster book - новая приемная книга]  It was a month since  [month since - месяц с тех пор, как] she had _Thistle Harvest_, so surely Mother could  [surely mother could - конечно, мать могла] not object. Valancy had read it four times—she knew whole passages  [knew whole passages - знала целые отрывки] off by heart.

And—she almost thought  [almost thought - почти думал] she would go  [would go - пошла] and see Dr. [see dr -  см. доктора]  Trent about that queer pain around  [queer pain around - странная боль вокруг] the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the palpitations were becoming annoying, [becoming annoying - становится раздражающей]  not to speak of an occasional dizzy moment  [occasional dizzy moment - иногда момент головокружения] and a queer shortness  [queer shortness - странная краткость] of breath. But could she go to see him without telling  [without telling - не сказав] any one? It was a most daring thought. [daring thought - смелая мысль]  None of the Stirlings ever consulted  [stirlings ever consulted - стирлинги когда-либо консультировались] a doctor without holding  [doctor without holding - доктор, не держась] a family council  [family council - семейный совет] and getting Uncle James’ approval. _Then_, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh  [ambrose marsh - амброуз болото] of Port Lawrence, [port lawrence - порт-лоуренса]  who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling.

But Valancy disliked Dr. [valancy disliked dr - валэнси не любила доктора]  Ambrose Marsh. [ambrose marsh - амброуз болото]  And, besides, she could not get to Port Lawrence, [port lawrence - порт-лоуренс]  fifteen miles away, [fifteen miles away - в пятнадцати милях отсюда]  without being taken there. She did not want any one to know about her heart. There would be such a fuss made  [fuss made - сумасшествие поднялось] and every member  [every member - каждый член] of the family would come  [family would come - семья придет] down and talk it over and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible tales  [horrible tales - ужасные истории] of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “just like that” and “dropped dead without a moment’s warning, my dear.”

Aunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a girl who would have heart trouble—“so pinched and peaked always”; and Uncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult, [personal insult - личное оскорбление]  when “no Stirling ever  [stirling ever - стирлинг когда-либо] had heart disease  [heart disease - болезнь сердца] before”; and Georgiana would forebode  [georgiana would forebode - джорджиана предчувствовала бы] in perfectly audible asides  [perfectly audible asides - прекрасно слышно помимо прочего] that “poor, dear little Doss  [dear little doss - дорогая маленькая придурок] isn’t long for this world, I’m afraid”; and Cousin Gladys would say, “Why, _my_ heart has been like that for _years_,” in a tone that implied no one else  [one else - еще ​​один] had any business even  [business even - даже бизнес] to have a heart; and Olive—Olive would merely look beautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy, [disgustingly healthy - отвратительно здоровый]  as if to say, “Why all this fuss over a faded superfluity like Doss when you have _me_?”

Valancy felt  [valancy felt - почувствовала валентность] that she couldn’t tell anybody unless  [tell anybody unless - скажи кому-нибудь, если только] she had to. She felt quite sure  [felt quite sure - чувствовала себя совершенно уверенной] there was nothing at all seriously wrong  [seriously wrong - серьезно неправильно] with her heart and no need of all the pother that would ensue  [would ensue - последует] if she mentioned it. She would just slip up quietly and see Dr. [see dr - см. доктора]  Trent that very day. As for his bill, she had the two hundred dollars  [two hundred dollars - двести долларов] that her father had put in the bank for her the day she was born. She was never allowed  [never allowed - никогда не позволял] to use even  [use even -  использовать даже] the interest of this, but she would secretly take  [would secretly take - тайно не взяла бы] out enough to pay Dr. [pay dr - платить доктору]  Trent.

Dr. Trent was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, [minded old fellow - мыслящий старый приятель]  but he was a recognised authority  [recognised authority - признанный авторитет] on heart disease, [heart disease - болезнь сердца]  even if he were only a general practitioner  [general practitioner -  врач общей практики] in out-of-the-world Deerwood. [world deerwood - мир дирвуд]  Dr. Trent was over seventy and there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. [retire soon - скоро уйти на пенсию]  None of the Stirling clan  [stirling clan - стирлинг клан] had ever gone  [ever gone - когда-либо уходивший] to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, [told cousin gladys - сказал двоюродному брату Глэдис]  ten years  [ten years - десять лет] before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed it. You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted your first-cousin—once-removed like  [removed like - удален как] that—not to mention that he was a Presbyterian when all the Stirlings went  [stirlings went - стирлинги ушли] to the Anglican church. [anglican church - англиканская церковь]  But Valancy, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea  [deep sea - глубокое море] of fuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take  [would take - возьмет] a chance with the devil.



 CHAPTER II [chapter ii - глава ii] 

 When Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - кузен палитс] knocked  [cousin stickles knocked - двоюродный брат сбит с толку] at her door, Valancy knew  [valancy knew - валэнси знала] it was half-past seven  [past seven - седьмого] and she must get  [must get - должна получить] up. As long as she could remember, [could remember - могла помнить]  Cousin Stickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Stickles and Mrs. Frederick Stirling  [frederick stirling - фредерик стирлинг] had been up since seven, [since seven - с семи]  but Valancy was allowed to lie abed half  [lie abed half - лежать в постели наполовину] an hour longer  [hour longer - на час дольше] because of a family tradition  [family tradition - семейная традиция] that she was delicate. Valancy got  [valancy got - валэнси получила] up, though she hated getting  [hated getting - ненавидела получать ] up more this morning than ever she had before. What was there to get up for? Another dreary day like all the days that had preceded it, full of meaningless little tasks, [meaningless little tasks - бессмысленные маленькие задачи]  joyless and unimportant, that benefited nobody. [benefited nobody - никто не приносил пользу]  But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for breakfast at eight o’clock. Hard and fast times  [fast times - быстрые времена] for meals were the rule in Mrs. Stirling’s household. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper at six, year in and year out. No excuses for being late were ever tolerated. [ever tolerated - всегда терпела]  So up Valancy got, shivering.

Valancy took  [valancy took - валанс взял] off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse, unbleached cotton, [unbleached cotton - неотбеленный хлопок]  with high neck  [high neck - высокий ворот] and long, tight sleeves. [tight sleeves - узкие рукава]  She put on undergarments of a similar nature, [similar nature - похожая натура]  a dress of brown gingham, [brown gingham - коричневая клетчатая ткань]  thick, black stockings  [black stockings - черные чулки] and rubber-heeled boots. [heeled boots - ботинки на каблуке]  Of late years  [late years - поздние годы] she had fallen into the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the looking-glass pulled  [glass pulled - стеклянные натянуты] down. The lines on her face did not show so plainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and looked at herself in the leprous mirror  [leprous mirror - прокаженное зеркало] with a passionate determination  [passionate determination - страстная решимость] to see herself as the world saw  [world saw - пила мира] her.

The result was rather dreadful. [rather dreadful - довольно ужасный]  Even a beauty would  [beauty would - красота бы] have found that harsh, unsoftened side- [unsoftened side - неразмягченный бок] light trying. [light trying - легкие попытки]  Valancy saw straight black hair, short and thin, always lustreless despite  [always lustreless despite - всегда бледный, несмотря на] the fact that she gave it one hundred strokes  [one hundred strokes - сто ударов] of the brush, neither more nor less, every night  [every night - каждую ночь] of her life and faithfully rubbed Redfern’s Hair Vigor  [hair vigor - волосы бодрость] into the roots, more lustreless than ever in its morning roughness; [morning roughness - утренняя шероховатость]  fine, straight, black brows; [black brows - черные брови]  a nose she had always felt  [always felt - всегда ощущалось] was much too small even  [small even - маленький даже] for her small, three-cornered, white face; [white face - белое лицо]  a small, pale mouth  [pale mouth - бледный рот] that always fell open  [always fell open - всегда распахивался] a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; [pointed white teeth - острые белые зубы ]  a figure thin  [figure thin - худая фигура] and flat-breasted, rather below the average height. [average height - средний рост]  She had somehow escaped  [somehow escaped - как-то вырвалось] the family high cheek- [family high cheek - семейные высокие щеки] bones, and her dark-brown eyes, [brown eyes - карие глаза]  too soft and shadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. [almost oriental - почти восточный]  Apart from her eyes she was neither pretty  [neither pretty - некрасивый] nor ugly—just insignificant-looking, she concluded bitterly. [concluded bitterly - кончает с горечью]  How plain the lines around  [lines around - морщины вокруг] her eyes and mouth were in that merciless light! [merciless light - беспощадный свет]  And never had her narrow, white face looked  [white face looked - белое лицо выглядело] so narrow and so white.

She did her hair in a pompadour. Pompadours had long gone  [long gone - давно нет] out of fashion, but they had been in when Valancy first put  [valancy first put - валантия первый раз] her hair up and Aunt Wellington  [aunt wellington - тетя веллингтон] had decided that she must always wear  [must always wear - надо всегда носить] her hair so.

“It is the _only_ way that becomes you. Your face is so small that you _must_ add height to it by a pompadour effect,” said Aunt Wellington, who always enunciated commonplaces  [always enunciated commonplaces - всегда провозглашает общие места] as if uttering profound  [uttering profound - изрекает глубокие] and important truths. [important truths - важные истины] 

Valancy had hankered to do her hair pulled low  [hair pulled low - волосы были низко стянуты] on her forehead, with puffs above the ears, as Olive was wearing hers. But Aunt Wellington’s dictum had such an effect on her that she never dared change  [never dared change -  никогда не осмеливался измениться] her style of hairdressing again. But then, there were so many things Valancy never dared do.

All her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly. [thought bitterly - горько думал]  From the very dawn of recollection, when she had been so horribly afraid  [horribly afraid - ужасно боялся] of the big black bear  [big black bear - большой черный медведь] that lived, so Cousin Stickles told  [cousin stickles told - двоюродный брат сказал] her, in the closet under the stairs.

“And I always will be—I know it—I can’t help it. I don’t know what it would be like not to be afraid of something.”

Afraid of her mother’s sulky fits—afraid of offending Uncle Benjamin—afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Wellington’s contempt—afraid of Aunt Isabel’s biting comments—afraid of Uncle James’ disapproval—afraid of offending the whole clan’s opinions and prejudices—afraid of not keeping up appearances—afraid to say what she really thought  [really thought - действительно думал] of  anything—afraid of poverty in her old age. [old age - старость]  Fear—fear—fear—she could never escape  [could never escape - не могла никогда сбежать] from it. It bound her and enmeshed her like a spider’s web of steel. Only in her Blue Castle  [blue castle - синий замок] could  [blue castle could - синий замок мог] she find temporary release. [find temporary release - найти временное облегчение]  And this morning Valancy could  [morning valancy could - утренняя вэланси могла] not believe she had a Blue Castle. She would never  [would never - никогда] be able to find it again. Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired—what had she to do with the fairy-like chatelaine  [like chatelaine - как шатлен] of the Blue Castle? She would cut  [would cut - не отрезал бы ] such childish nonsense  [childish nonsense - детский бред] out of her life forever  [life forever - жизнь навсегда] and face reality unflinchingly. [face reality unflinchingly - непоколебимо смотреть в лицо реальности] 

She turned from her unfriendly mirror  [unfriendly mirror - недружелюбное зеркало] and looked out. The ugliness of the view always struck  [view always struck - вид всегда поражает] her like a blow; the ragged fence, [ragged fence - рваный забор]  the tumble-down old carriage- [old carriage - старая карета] shop in the next lot, [next lot - следующая партия]  plastered with crude, violently coloured advertisements; [violently coloured advertisements - ярко раскрашенная реклама]  the grimy railway station beyond, with the awful derelicts  [awful derelicts - ужасные изгои] that were always hanging around  [always hanging around - всегда торчит] it even at this early hour. [early hour -  ранний час]  In the pouring rain everything looked worse than usual, especially the beastly advertisement, [beastly advertisement - звериная реклама]  “Keep that schoolgirl complexion. [schoolgirl complexion - лицо школьницы] ” Valancy _had_ kept her schoolgirl complexion. That was just the trouble. There was not a gleam of beauty anywhere—“exactly like my life,” thought Valancy drearily. Her brief bitterness  [brief bitterness - короткая горечь] had passed. She accepted facts  [accepted facts - признанные факты] as resignedly as she had always accepted  [always accepted - всегда принимается] them. She was one of the people whom life always passes  [life always passes - жизнь всегда проходит] by. There was no altering that fact.

In this mood Valancy went  [mood valancy went - настроение вэланси ушло] down to breakfast.



 CHAPTER III [chapter iii - глава iii] 

 Breakfast was always the same. Oatmeal porridge, [oatmeal porridge - овсяная каша]  which Valancy loathed, [valancy loathed - валэнси ненавидела]  toast and tea, and one teaspoonful  [one teaspoonful - одна чайная ложка] of marmalade. Mrs. Frederick thought two teaspoonfuls extravagant—but that did not matter to Valancy, who hated marmalade, [hated marmalade - ненавистный мармелад]  too. The chilly, gloomy little dining- [gloomy little dining - мрачная столовая] room was chillier and gloomier than usual; the rain streamed  [rain streamed - лил дождь] down outside the window; departed Stirlings, [departed stirlings - ушедшие стирлинги]  in atrocious, gilt frames, [gilt frames - позолоченные рамки]  wider than the pictures, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Stickles wished Valancy many happy returns of the day!

“Sit up straight, Doss,” was all her mother said. [mother said - мать сказала] 

Valancy sat  [valancy sat - валенси сидела] up straight. She talked to her mother and Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродная сестра] of the things they always talked  [always talked - всегда говорила] of. She never wondered  [never wondered - никогда не задумывалась] what would happen  [would happen -  случится] if she tried to talk of something else. [something else - что-то еще]  She knew. Therefore she never did it.

Mrs. Frederick was offended with Providence for sending a rainy day  [rainy day - дождливый день] when she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky silence  [sulky silence - угрюмое молчание] for which Valancy was rather grateful. [rather grateful - довольно благодарна]  But Christine Stickles whined endlessly on as usual, complaining about everything—the weather, the leak in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter—Valancy felt at once she had buttered her toast too lavishly—the epidemic of mumps in Deerwood.

“Doss will be sure to ketch them,” she foreboded.

“Doss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,” said Mrs. Frederick shortly. [frederick shortly - фредерик вскоре] 

Valancy had never had mumps—or whooping cough—or chicken-pox—or measles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds every winter. Doss’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the family. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent  [could prevent - может предотвратить] her from catching them. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles -  двоюродный брат Стиклс] did their heroic best. [heroic best - героический лучший]  One winter  [one winter - одну зиму] they kept Valancy housed  [kept valancy housed - держала вэлэнси в доме] up from November to May, in the warm sitting- [warm sitting - теплое сидение] room. She was not even allowed  [even allowed - даже позволил] to go to church. And Valancy took cold  [valancy took cold - валенси остыла] after cold and ended up with bronchitis in June.

“None of _my_ family were ever like  [ever like - когда-либо подобное] that,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs - , – сказала миссис]  Frederick, implying that it must be a Stirling tendency. [stirling tendency - стирлинг склонность] 

“The Stirlings seldom take colds,” said Cousin Stickles resentfully. _She_ had been a Stirling.

“I think,” said Mrs. Frederick, “that if a person makes  [person makes - человек делает] up her mind _not_ to have colds she will not _have_ colds.”

So that was the trouble. It was all Valancy’s own fault.

But on this particular morning Valancy’s unbearable grievance  [unbearable grievance - невыносимая обида] was that she was called Doss. [called doss - называется досс]  She had endured it for twenty-nine years, [nine years - девять лет]  and all at once she felt she could not endure it any longer. Her full name  [full name - полное имя] was Valancy Jane. [valancy jane - вэлэнси джейн]  Valancy Jane was rather terrible, [rather terrible - довольно ужасно]  but she liked Valancy, [liked valancy - любимая вэлэнси]  with its odd, out-land tang. [land tang -  земельный запах]  It was always a wonder to Valancy that the Stirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that her maternal grandfather, [maternal grandfather - дедушка по материнской линии]  old Amos Wansbarra, [old amos wansbarra - старый амос вансбарра]  had chosen the name for her. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the whole connection got  [whole connection got - вся связь досталась] out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss. She never got Valancy  [never got valancy - никогда не получала вэлэнси] from any one but outsiders.

Mrs. Frederick looked  [frederick looked - фредерик выглядел] at her daughter in astonishment. She wore glasses  [wore glasses - носил очки] with enormously strong lenses  [enormously strong lenses - чрезвычайно сильные линзы] that gave her eyes a peculiarly disagreeable appearance. [peculiarly disagreeable appearance - необычайно неприятная внешность] 

“What is the matter with Doss?”

“It—seems so childish,” faltered Valancy.

“Oh!” Mrs. Frederick had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile  [wansbarra smile - улыбка Вансбарры] was not an asset. “I see. Well, it should suit _you_ then. You are childish enough  [childish enough - достаточно ребяческий] in all conscience, my dear child.”

“I am twenty-nine,” said the dear child desperately. [dear child desperately - дорогое дитя в отчаянии] 

“I wouldn’t proclaim it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,” said Mrs. Frederick. “Twenty-nine! _I_ had been married nine years  [married nine years - женат девять лет] when I was twenty-nine.”

“_I_ was married at seventeen,” said Cousin Stickles proudly.

Valancy looked  [valancy looked - валенси выглядела] at them furtively. Mrs. Frederick, except for those terrible glasses  [terrible glasses - ужасные очки] and the hooked nose  [hooked nose - нос с горбинкой] that made her look more like a parrot than a parrot itself could look, [could look - могла смотреть]  was not ill-looking. At twenty she might have been quite pretty. [quite pretty - довольно хорошенькая]  But Cousin Stickles! [cousin stickles - двоюродная сестра]  And yet Christine Stickles  [yet christine stickles - но Кристин прилипает] had once been desirable in some man’s eyes. Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валанси чувствовала] that Cousin Stickles, with her broad, flat, wrinkled face, [wrinkled face - морщинистое лицо ]  a mole right  [mole right - родинка справа] on the end of her dumpy nose, [dumpy nose - туповатый нос]  bristling hairs  [bristling hairs - щетинистые волосы] on her chin, wrinkled yellow neck, [wrinkled yellow neck - морщинистая желтая шея]  pale, protruding eyes, [protruding eyes - выпученные глаза]  and thin, puckered mouth, [puckered mouth - сморщенный рот]  had yet this advantage over her—this right to look down on her. And even yet Cousin Stickles was necessary to Mrs. Frederick. Valancy wondered pitifully  [valancy wondered pitifully - жалко недоумевала Валенси] what it would be like to be wanted by some one—needed by some one. No one in the whole world needed  [whole world needed - всему миру нужен] her, or would miss anything  [would miss anything - будет скучать по чему-либо] from life if she dropped suddenly  [dropped suddenly - внезапно опустилась] out of it. She was a disappointment to her mother. No one loved  [one loved - одна любимая] her. She had never so much as had a girl friend. [girl friend - подружка] 

“I haven’t even a gift for friendship,” she had once admitted to herself pitifully.

“Doss, you haven’t eaten your crusts,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly. [frederick rebukingly - фредерик укоризненно] 

It rained all the forenoon without cessation. [forenoon without cessation - до полудня без перерыва]  Valancy pieced  [valancy pieced - валанси в комплекте] a quilt. Valancy hated piecing quilts. And there was no need of it. The house was full of quilts. There were three big chests, [three big chests - три большие сундуки]  packed with quilts, in the attic. Mrs. Frederick had begun storing away quilts when Valancy was seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem likely  [seem likely - вероятно] that Valancy would ever need them. But Valancy must  [valancy must - валанс должен] be at work and fancy work materials  [fancy work materials - причудливые рабочие материалы] were too expensive. Idleness was a cardinal sin  [cardinal sin - смертный грех] in the Stirling household. [stirling household - стирлингский дом]  When Valancy had been a child she had been made to write down every night, [every night - каждую ночь]  in a small, hated, black notebook, [black notebook - черный блокнот]  all the minutes she had spent in idleness that day. On Sundays her mother made  [mother made - мать делала] her tot them up and pray over them.

On this particular forenoon  [particular forenoon - особое утро] of this day of destiny Valancy spent  [destiny valancy spent - судьба валанса потрачена] only ten minutes  [ten minutes - десять минут] in idleness. At least, Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles would  [cousin stickles would - двоюродный брат палочки бы] have called it idleness. She went to her room to get a better thimble  [better thimble - лучше наперсток] and she opened _Thistle Harvest_ guiltily at random.

“The woods are so human,” wrote John Foster, “that to know them one must live  [one must live - надо жить] with them. An occasional saunter  [occasional saunter - изредка прогуливаться] through them, keeping to the well-trodden paths, [trodden paths - протоптанные тропы]  will never admit us  [never admit us - никогда не признавать нас] to their intimacy. If we wish to be friends we must seek  [must seek - должен искать] them out and win them by frequent, reverent visits  [reverent visits - благоговейные визиты] at all hours; by morning, by noon, and by night; and at all seasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter. Otherwise we can never really know  [never really know - никогда не знаешь по-настоящему] them and any pretence we may make  [may make - может сделать] to the contrary will never impose  [never impose - никогда не навязывать] on them. They have their own effective way  [effective way - эффективный способ] of keeping aliens  [keeping aliens - содержание инопланетян ] at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual sightseers. [mere casual sightseers - просто случайные зрители]  It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except sheer love of them; they will find us  [find us - найди нас] out at once and hide all their sweet, old-world secrets  [world secrets - мировые тайны] from us. But if they know we come to them because we love them they will be very kind to us and give us  [give us - дай нам] such treasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any market-place. For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly  [give unstintedly - отдавать без остатка] and hold nothing back  [hold nothing back - ничего не сдерживаешь] from their true worshippers. [true worshippers - истинные поклонники]  We must go  [must go - должен уйти] to them lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn  [shall learn - научиться] what poignant loveliness lurks  [poignant loveliness lurks - пронзительная прелесть таится] in the wild places  [wild places - дикие места] and silent intervals, [silent intervals - тихие промежутки]  lying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music  [unearthly music - неземную музыку] are harped on aged pine boughs  [aged pine boughs - старые сосновые ветки] or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate savours exhale  [delicate savours exhale - нежный аромат выдыхается] from mosses and ferns in sunny corners  [sunny corners - солнечные уголки] or on damp brooklands, [damp brooklands - сырые ручьи]  what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt  [older time haunt - старое время преследует] them. Then the immortal heart  [immortal heart - бессмертное сердце] of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle life  [subtle life - тонкую жизнь] will steal into our veins and make us  [make us -  заставь нас] its own forever, so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet  [shall yet - должны еще] be drawn back  [drawn back - отталкивает] to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.”

“Doss,” called her mother from the hall below, “what are you doing all by yourself in that room?”

Valancy dropped _Thistle Harvest_ like a hot coal  [hot coal - горячий уголь] and fled downstairs  [fled downstairs - сбежали вниз] to her patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration  [strange exhilaration - странное веселье] of spirit that always came momentarily  [always came momentarily - всегда приходил на мгновение] to her when she dipped into one of John Foster’s books. Valancy did not know much  [know much - много знаю] about woods—except the haunted groves  [haunted groves - призрачные рощи] of oak and pine around  [pine around - сосна вокруг] her Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  But she had always secretly hankered  [always secretly hankered - всегда тайно страстно желал] after them and a Foster book  [foster book - приемная книга] about woods was the next best thing  [next best thing - следующая лучшая вещь] to the woods themselves.

At noon it stopped raining, [stopped raining - дождь прекратился]  but the sun did not come out until three. Then Valancy timidly said  [valancy timidly said - валенси робко сказала] she thought she would go uptown. [would go uptown - бы иди в город] 

“What do you want to go uptown  [go uptown - идти в город] for?” demanded her mother.

“I want to get a book from the library.”

“You got a book from the library only last week.”

“No, it was four weeks.”

“Four weeks. Nonsense!”

“Really it was, Mother.”

“You are mistaken. It cannot possibly  [cannot possibly - не может быть] have been more than two weeks. [two weeks - две недели]  I dislike contradiction. [dislike contradiction - не нравится противоречие]  And I do not see what you want to get a book for, anyhow. You waste too much time reading.”

“Of what value is my time?” asked Valancy bitterly.

“Doss! Don’t speak in that tone to _me_.”

“We need some tea,” said Cousin Stickles. “She might go  [might go - может пойти] and get that if she wants a walk—though this damp weather  [damp weather - сырая погода] is bad for colds.”

They argued the matter for ten minutes longer  [ten minutes longer - на десять минут дольше] and finally Mrs. [finally mrs - наконец-то миссис]  Frederick agreed rather grudgingly that Valancy might go. [valancy might go - валенси может уйти] 



 CHAPTER IV [chapter iv - глава 4] 

 “Got your rubbers on?” called Cousin Stickles, as Valancy left  [valancy left - валенси ушла] the house.

Christine Stickles  [christine stickles - кристин палочки] had never once forgotten to ask that question when Valancy went  [valancy went - валэнси ушла] out on a damp day. [damp day - влажный день ] 

“Yes.”

“Have you got your flannel petticoat  [flannel petticoat - фланелевая нижняя юбка] on?” asked Mrs. Frederick.

“No.”

“Doss, I really do not understand you. Do you want to catch your death of cold _again_?” Her voice implied  [voice implied - подразумевается голос] that Valancy had died of a cold several times already. “Go upstairs this minute and put it on!”

“Mother, I don’t _need_ a flannel petticoat. [flannel petticoat - фланелевая нижняя юбка]  My sateen one  [sateen one - сатиновая] is warm enough.”

“Doss, remember you had bronchitis two years ago. Go and do as you are told!”

Valancy went, [valancy went - галантерея пошла]  though nobody  [though nobody - хотя никто] will ever know  [ever know - никогда не узнаешь] just how near she came to hurling the rubber-plant into the street before she went. She hated that grey flannel petticoat  [grey flannel petticoat - серая фланелевая нижняя юбка] more than any other garment she owned. Olive never  [olive never - оливковое никогда] had to wear flannel petticoats. [wear flannel petticoats - носить фланелевые нижние юбки]  Olive wore ruffled silk and sheer lawn  [sheer lawn - чистый газон] and filmy laced flounces. [filmy laced flounces - пленочные ажурные воланы]  But Olive’s father had “married money” and Olive never had bronchitis. So there you were.

“I don’t envy Jennie  [envy jennie - завидую Дженни] the man,” thought Valancy sincerely—Clayton Markley was not one of her many ideals—“but I _do_ envy her the house. It’s such a nice young house. [nice young house - хороший молодой дом]  Oh, if I could only have a house of my own—ever so poor, so tiny—but my own! But then,” she added bitterly, [added bitterly - горько добавил]  “there is no use in yowling for the moon when you can’t even get  [even get - даже получать] a tallow candle.”

In dreamland nothing would  [dreamland nothing would - страна грез ничто не могло бы] do Valancy but a castle of pale sapphire. [pale sapphire - бледный сапфир]  In real life  [real life - реальная жизнь] she would have been fully satisfied  [fully satisfied - полностью доволен] with a little house  [little house - маленький дом] of her own. She envied Jennie Lloyd  [envied jennie lloyd - завидовал Дженни Ллойд] more fiercely than ever today. [ever today - когда-либо сегодня]  Jennie was not so much better looking  [much better looking - намного лучше выглядит] than she was, and not so very much younger. [much younger - намного моложе]  Yet she was to have this delightful house. [delightful house - восхитительный дом]  And the nicest little Wedgwood teacups—Valancy had seen them; an open fireplace, [open fireplace - открытый камин]  and monogrammed linen; [monogrammed linen - белье с монограммой]  hemstitched tablecloths, [hemstitched tablecloths - скатерти с строчкой]  and china-closets. Why did _everything_ come to some girls and _nothing_ to others? It wasn’t fair.

Valancy was once more seething with rebellion as she walked along, [walked along - шел вдоль]  a prim, dowdy little figure  [dowdy little figure - неряшливая фигурка] in her shabby raincoat  [shabby raincoat - потрепанный плащ] and three-year-old hat, [old hat - старый шляпа]  splashed occasionally  [splashed occasionally - забрызгал изредка] by the mud of a passing motor  [passing motor - проезжающий мотор] with its insulting shrieks. [insulting shrieks - оскорбительные визги]  Motors were still rather  [still rather - еще довольно] a novelty in Deerwood, though they were common in Port Lawrence, [port lawrence - порт-лоуренс]  and most of the summer residents  [summer residents - дачники] up at Muskoka had them. In Deerwood only some of the smart set  [smart set - нарядным набором] had them; for even Deerwood  [even deerwood - даже олень] was divided into sets. There was the smart set—the intellectual set—the old-family set—of which the Stirlings were members—the common run, [common run - общий пробег]  and a few pariahs. Not one of the Stirling clan  [stirling clan - стирлинг клан] had as yet condescended  [yet condescended - пока снисходительно] to a motor, though Olive  [though olive - хотя оливковый] was teasing her father to have one. Valancy had never even  [never even - даже никогда] been in a motorcar. But she did not hanker after this. In truth, she felt rather afraid  [felt rather afraid - почувствовал себя немного испуганным] of motorcars, especially at night. They seemed to be too much like big purring beasts that might turn  [might turn - может повернуться] and crush you—or make some terrible savage leap somewhere. On the steep mountain trails around her Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly pace; in real life Valancy would have been quite contented  [quite contented - вполне доволен] to drive in a buggy behind  [buggy behind - багги сзади] a nice horse. [nice horse - милая лошадь]  She got a buggy drive  [buggy drive - багги-драйв] only when some uncle or cousin remembered  [cousin remembered - двоюродный брат вспомнил] to fling her “a chance,” like a bone to a dog.



 CHAPTER V [chapter v - глава v] 

 Of course she must buy  [must buy - должен купить] the tea in Uncle Benjamin’s grocery-store. To buy it anywhere else  [anywhere else - где-нибудь еще] was unthinkable. Yet Valancy hated  [yet valancy hated - все же ненавидит валэнси] to go to Uncle Benjamin’s store on her twenty-ninth birthday. [ninth birthday - девятый день рождения]  There was no hope that he would not remember it.

“Why,” demanded Uncle Benjamin, leeringly, as he tied up her tea, “are young ladies like bad grammarians?”

Valancy, with Uncle Benjamin’s will in the background of her mind, said meekly, [said meekly - сказал кротко ]  “I don’t know. Why?”

“Because,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin, “they can’t decline matrimony.”

The two clerks, [two clerks - два клерка]  Joe Hammond  [joe hammond - джо хэммонд] and Claude Bertram, [claude bertram - клод бертрам]  chuckled also, [chuckled also - также хихикал]  and Valancy disliked  [valancy disliked - валанси не любила] them a little more than ever. On the first day Claude Bertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper to Joe, “Who is that?” And Joe had said, “Valancy Stirling—one of the Deerwood old maids.” “Curable or incurable?” Claude had asked with a snicker, evidently thinking  [evidently thinking - очевидно думал] the question very clever. Valancy smarted anew  [valancy smarted anew - валенси снова заболела] with the sting of that old recollection. [old recollection - старое воспоминание] 

“Twenty-nine,” Uncle Benjamin was saying. “Dear me, Doss, you’re dangerously near  [dangerously near - опасно близко] the second corner  [second corner - второй угол] and not even thinking  [even thinking - даже думал] of getting married yet. [getting married yet - ещё женюсь]  Twenty-nine. It seems impossible.”

Then Uncle Benjamin said  [uncle benjamin said - дядя бенджамин сказал] an original thing. [original thing - оригинальная вещь]  Uncle Benjamin said, “How time does fly!”

“_I_ think it _crawls_,” said Valancy passionately. Passion was so alien to Uncle Benjamin’s conception of Valancy that he didn’t know what to make of her. To cover his confusion, he asked another conundrum  [asked another conundrum - задал ещё одну головоломку] as he tied up her beans—Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last moment  [last moment -  последний момент] that they must have beans. Beans were cheap and filling.

“What two ages  [two ages - два возраста] are apt to prove illusory?” asked Uncle Benjamin; and, not waiting for Valancy to “give it up,” he added, “Mir-age and marriage.”

“M-i-r-a-g-e is pronounced _mirazh_,” said Valancy shortly, picking up her tea and her beans. For the moment she did not care whether Uncle Benjamin cut her out of his will or not. She walked out of the store while Uncle Benjamin stared  [uncle benjamin stared - дядя бенджамин уставился] after her with his mouth open. [mouth open - открыв рот]  Then he shook his head.

“Poor Doss is taking it hard,” he said.

Valancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing. [next crossing - следующий переход]  Why had she lost her patience like  [patience like - наберитесь терпения] that? Uncle Benjamin would  [uncle benjamin would - дядя бенджамин] be annoyed and would likely tell  [would likely tell - вероятно, сказал бы] her mother that Doss had been impertinent—“to _me_!”—and her mother would lecture  [mother would lecture - мать прочитала бы лекцию] her for a week.

“I’ve held my tongue for twenty years,” thought Valancy. “Why couldn’t I have held it once more?”

Yes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, [valancy reflected - отражение валентности]  since she had first been twitted with her loverless condition. [loverless condition - состояние без любовников]  She remembered the bitter moment perfectly. [bitter moment perfectly - горький момент совершенно]  She was just nine years old  [nine years old - девять лет] and she was standing alone  [standing alone - стоять в одиночестве] on the school playground  [school playground - школьная площадка] while the other little girls  [little girls - маленькие девочки] of her class were playing a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner before you could play. [could play - могла бы играть]  Nobody had chosen Valancy—little, pale, black-haired Valancy, [haired valancy - волосатая подкладка]  with her prim, long-sleeved apron  [sleeved apron - фартук с рукавами] and odd, slanted eyes. [slanted eyes - раскосые глаза ] 

“Oh,” said a pretty little girl  [pretty little girl - милая девочка] to her, “I’m so sorry for you. You haven’t got a beau.”

Valancy had said defiantly, [said defiantly - сказала вызывающе]  as she continued to say for twenty years, [twenty years - двадцать лет]  “I don’t _want_ a beau.” But this afternoon Valancy  [afternoon valancy - дневная подкладка] once and for all stopped saying  [stopped saying - перестала говорить] that.

“I’m going to be honest with myself anyhow,” she thought savagely. [thought savagely - дико подумал]  “Uncle Benjamin’s riddles hurt  [riddles hurt -  загадки причиняют боль] me because they are true. I _do_ want to be married. I want a house of my own—I want a husband of my own—I want sweet, [want sweet - хочу сладкого]  little fat _babies_ of my own—” Valancy stopped suddenly aghast at her own recklessness. She felt sure  [felt sure - почувствовал себя уверенным] that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who passed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved of them thoroughly. Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling—had been afraid of him ever since  [ever since - с тех пор] the Sunday, twenty-three years  [three years - три года] before, when he had first come  [first come - первый пришел] to St. Albans’. Valancy had been too late for Sunday School  [sunday school - воскресная школа] that day and she had gone into the church timidly  [church timidly - церковь робко] and sat in their pew. No one else  [one else - ещё один] was in the church—nobody except the new rector, [new rector - новый ректор]  Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling stood  [stalling stood - стоял встал] up in front of the choir door, [choir door - дверь хора]  beckoned to her, and said sternly, [said sternly - сказал сурово]  “Little boy, come up here.”

Valancy had stared around  [stared around - осматривался вокруг] her. There was no little boy—there was no one in all the huge church  [huge church - огромная церковь] but herself. This strange man  [strange man - странный человек] with the blue glasses  [blue glasses - синие очки] couldn’t mean her. She was not a boy.

“Little boy,” repeated Dr. Stalling, more sternly still, [sternly still - сурово неподвижно]  shaking his forefinger fiercely  [forefinger fiercely - указательный палец яростно] at her, “come up here at once!”

Valancy arose  [valancy arose - поднялась валентность] as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle. She was too terrified to do anything else. [anything else - что-нибудь еще]  What dreadful thing  [dreadful thing - ужасная вещь ] was going to happen to her? What _had_ happened to her? Had she actually turned  [actually turned - на самом деле повернулся] into a boy? She came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling shook  [stalling shook - остановка тряслась] his forefinger—such a long, knuckly forefinger—at her and said:

“Little boy, take off your hat.”

Valancy took  [valancy took - валенси взял] off her hat. She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down her back, but Dr. Stalling was short-sighted and did not perceive it.

“Little boy, go back  [go back - вернись] to your seat and _always_ take off your hat in church. _Remember_!”

Valancy went back  [valancy went back - валенси вернулся] to her seat carrying  [seat carrying - сиденье нес] her hat like  [hat like - шляпа как] an automaton. Presently her mother came  [mother came - мама пришла] in.

“Doss,” said Mrs. Stirling, “what do you mean by taking off your hat? Put it on instantly!”

Dr. Stalling found  [stalling found - стоянка найдена] out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy—who did not laugh. She never got  [never got - никогда не получил] over her dread of Dr. Stalling. And now to be caught by him on the street corner, [street corner - угол улицы]  thinking such things!

Valancy got  [valancy got - валенси получил] her John Foster book—_Magic of Wings_. “His latest—all about birds,” said Miss Clarkson. She had almost decided  [almost decided - почти решил] that she would go home, [go home - пошел бы домой]  [would go home - пошел бы домой]  instead of going to see Dr. [see dr - см. доктора ]  Trent. Her courage had failed her. She was afraid of offending Uncle James—afraid of angering her mother—afraid of facing gruff, [facing gruff - лицом к лицу с грубым]  shaggy-browed old Dr. [browed old dr - нахмурился старый доктор]  Trent, who would probably tell  [would probably tell - вероятно, сказал бы] her, as he had told Cousin Gladys, [told cousin gladys - сказал кузине Глэдис]  that her trouble was entirely imaginary  [entirely imaginary - совершенно воображаемым] and that she only had it because she liked to have it. No, she would not go; she would get  [would get - получил бы] a bottle of Redfern’s Purple Pills  [purple pills - фиолетовые таблетки] instead. [purple pills instead - вместо этого фиолетовые таблетки]  Redfern’s Purple Pills were the standard medicine  [standard medicine - стандартная медицина] of the Stirling clan. [stirling clan - стирлинг клан]  Had they not cured Second Cousin Geraldine when five doctors  [five doctors - пять врачей] had given her up? Valancy always felt  [valancy always felt - валэнси всегда чувствовал] very sceptical concerning  [sceptical concerning - скептически относится] the virtues of the Purple Pills; but there _might_ be something in them; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. [face dr - лицо доктор]  Trent alone. [trent alone - трент в одиночестве]  She would glance  [would glance - взглянул бы] over the magazines in the reading-room a few minutes and then go home.

Valancy tried  [valancy tried - валэнси пытался] to read a story, but it made her furious. On every page  [every page - каждый страница] was a picture of the heroine surrounded  [heroine surrounded - героиня окружена] by adoring men. [adoring men - обожание мужчин]  And here was she, Valancy Stirling, [valancy stirling - валэнси стерлинг]  who could not get a solitary beau! [solitary beau - одинокий красавчик]  Valancy slammed  [valancy slammed - валэнси захлопнула] the magazine shut; [magazine shut - журнал закрыт]  she opened _Magic of Wings_. Her eyes fell  [eyes fell - глаза упали] on the paragraph that changed her life.

“_Fear is the original sin_,” wrote John Foster. “_Almost all the evil in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something_. It is a cold, slimy serpent coiling  [slimy serpent coiling - склизкая змея, свернувшаяся кольцами] about you. It is horrible to live with fear; and it is of all things degrading.”

Valancy shut _Magic of Wings_ and stood up. She would go  [would go - пошла бы] and see Dr. [see dr - см. доктора]  Trent.



 CHAPTER VI [chapter vi - главу ви] 

 The ordeal was not so dreadful, after all. Dr. Trent was as gruff and abrupt as usual, but he did not tell her ailment was imaginary. After he had listened to her symptoms and asked a few questions and made a quick examination, [quick examination - быстрый осмотр]  he sat for a moment looking  [moment looking - момент выглядишь] at her quite intently. [quite intently - весьма внимательно]  Valancy thought  [valancy thought - валанси думал] he looked as if he were sorry for her. She caught her breath for a moment. Was the trouble serious? [trouble serious - проблема серьезная]  Oh, it couldn’t be, surely—it really hadn’t bothered her _much_—only lately it had got a little worse. [little worse - немного хуже] 

Dr. Trent opened  [trent opened - трент открыл] his mouth—but before he could speak  [could speak - мог говорить] the telephone at his elbow rang sharply. [elbow rang sharply - резко зазвенело в локте]  He picked up the receiver. Valancy, watching him, saw his face change suddenly  [face change suddenly - внезапно изменилось лицо] as he listened, “‘Lo—yes—yes—_what_?—yes—yes”—a brief interval—“My God!”

Dr. Trent dropped  [trent dropped - уличная дверь] the receiver, dashed out of the room and upstairs without even  [upstairs without even -  наверху, даже не помчавшись вниз] a glance at Valancy. She heard him rushing madly  [rushing madly - рывком распахнул] about overhead, barking out a few remarks to somebody—presumably his housekeeper. Then he came tearing downstairs  [came tearing downstairs - трент упал] with a club bag  [club bag - валэнси сидела одна] in his hand, snatched his hat and coat from the rack, jerked open  [jerked open - клубную сумку] the street door  [street door - бешено мчится] and rushed down the street in the direction of the station.

Valancy sat alone  [valancy sat alone - игнорируя дядю джеймса] in the little office, [little office - джон фостер]  feeling more absolutely foolish  [absolutely foolish - валэнси роуз] than she had ever felt  [ever felt - совершенно глупо] before in her life. Foolish—and humiliated. So this was all that had come of her heroic determination  [heroic determination - ничего не добился] to live up to John Foster  [john foster - героическая решимость] and cast fear aside. [cast fear aside - какое-то сообщение]  Not only was she a failure as a relative and non-existent as a sweetheart or friend, but she was not even of any importance as a patient. Dr. Trent had forgotten her very presence in his excitement over whatever message  [whatever message - маленький офис] had come by the telephone. She had gained nothing  [gained nothing -  семейная традиция] by ignoring Uncle James  [ignoring uncle james - отбросил страх] and flying in the face of family tradition. [family tradition - когда-либо чувствовала себя] 

For a moment she was afraid she was going to cry. It _was_ all so—ridiculous. Then she heard Dr. [heard dr - искажённую улыбку]  Trent’s housekeeper coming  [housekeeper coming - услышала доктора] down the stairs. Valancy rose  [valancy rose - дверь офиса] and went to the office door. [office door - приходит экономка] 

“The doctor forgot  [doctor forgot - ужасно ранен] all about me,” she said with a twisted smile. [twisted smile - доктор забыл] 

“Well, that’s too bad,” said Mrs. Patterson sympathetically. [patterson sympathetically - большое удивление]  “But it wasn’t much wonder, [much wonder - мисс стерлинг]  poor man. [poor man - паттерсон с сочувствием]  That was a telegram they ’phoned over from the Port. His son has been terribly injured  [terribly injured - десять минут] in an auto accident  [auto accident - всё случается ] in Montreal. The doctor had just ten minutes  [ten minutes - бедняга] to catch the train. I don’t know what he’ll do if anything happens  [anything happens - удивляюсь, что бедный доктор] to Ned—he’s just bound up in the boy. You’ll have to come again, Miss Stirling. [miss stirling - автокатастрофа]  I hope it’s nothing serious.”

“Oh, no, nothing serious,” agreed Valancy. She felt a little less humiliated. [little less humiliated - валэнси пошла домой]  It was no wonder poor Dr. [wonder poor dr - чуть менее униженный]  Trent had forgotten her at such a moment. Nevertheless, she felt very flat and discouraged as she went down the street.

Valancy went home  [valancy went home - приближается к ужину] by the short-cut of Lover’s Lane. She did not often go  [often go - маленькие секреты] through Lover’s Lane—but it was getting near supper- [getting near supper - лейн отмотал назад] time and it would never  [would never - часто пошли] do to be late. Lover’s Lane wound back  [lane wound back - молодые девушки] of the village, under great elms  [great elms - искренне разговаривали] and maples, and deserved its name. It was hard to go there at any time and not find some canoodling couple—or young girls  [young girls - никогда бы не] in pairs, arms intertwined, [arms intertwined - талия совершенно бессовестно]  earnestly talking  [earnestly talking - переплели руки] over their little secrets. [little secrets - большие вязы]  Valancy didn’t know which made her feel more self-conscious and uncomfortable.

This evening she encountered both. She met Connie Hale  [met connie hale -  чувствовал себя совершенно уверенным] and Kate Bayley, [kate bayley - болтаюсь]  in new pink organdy dresses with flowers stuck coquettishly  [flowers stuck coquettishly - молодая пара] in their glossy, bare hair. [bare hair - еще одна вспышка]  Valancy had never had a pink dress  [pink dress - никогда не ходил] or worn flowers  [worn flowers - валэнси стерлинг] in her hair. Then she passed a young couple  [young couple - потертые цветы] she didn’t know, dandering along, [dandering along - голые волосы]  oblivious to everything but themselves. The young man’s arm was around the girl’s waist quite shamelessly. [waist quite shamelessly - познакомилась с конни хейл]  Valancy had never walked  [never walked - могу уйти] with a man’s arm about her. She felt that she ought to be shocked—they might leave  [might leave - просто завидую] that sort of thing for the screening twilight, [screening twilight - розовое платье]  at least—but she wasn’t shocked. In another flash  [another flash -  старый серый слоссон] of desperate, stark honesty  [stark honesty - экранизирующие сумерки] she owned to herself that she was merely envious. [merely envious - кейт бэйли]  When she passed them she felt quite sure  [felt quite sure - цветы кокетливо торчали] they were laughing at her—pitying her—“there’s that queer little old maid, Valancy Stirling. [valancy stirling - совершенно бесцветный]  They say she never had a beau in her whole life”—Valancy fairly ran to get out of Lover’s Lane. Never had she felt so utterly colourless  [utterly colourless - абсолютная честность] and skinny and insignificant.

Just where Lover’s Lane debouched  [lane debouched - позорный мог] on the street, an old car  [old car - валэнси знал] was parked. Valancy knew  [valancy knew - лейн распустил] that car well—by sound, at least—and everybody in Deerwood knew  [deerwood knew - печально известный барни снайт] it. This was before the phrase “tin Lizzie” had come into circulation—in Deerwood, at least; but if it had been known, this car was the tinniest of Lizzies—though it was not a Ford but an old Grey Slosson. [old grey slosson - старая машина]  Nothing more battered and disreputable could  [disreputable could - дирвуд знал] be imagined.

It was that night the Prince of the Blue Castle changed  [blue castle changed - голубой замок изменился] from a being of grim jaw  [grim jaw - угрюмая челюсть] and hair with a dash of premature grey  [premature grey - преждевременная седина] to a rakish individual  [rakish individual - лихая личность] with overlong, tawny hair, [tawny hair - каштановые волосы]  dashed with red, dark-brown eyes, [brown eyes - карие глаза]  and ears that stuck out just enough to give him an alert look  [alert look - настороженный взгляд] but not enough to be called flying jibs. [called flying jibs - называемое летающими кливерами]  But he still retained something  [still retained something - все еще сохранил что-то] a little grim  [little grim - немного мрачная] about the jaw.

Barney Snaith looked even more disreputable than usual just now. It was very evident that he hadn’t shaved for days, and his hands and arms, bare to the shoulders, were black with grease. But he was whistling gleefully  [whistling gleefully - радостно насвистывает] to himself and he seemed so happy that Valancy envied  [valancy envied - валэнси завидовала] him. She envied him his light-heartedness and his irresponsibility and his mysterious little cabin  [mysterious little cabin - загадочная хижина] up on an island in Lake Mistawis—even his rackety old Grey Slosson. Neither he nor his car had to be respectable and live up to traditions. When he rattled past  [rattled past -  грохотал мимо] her a few minutes later, [minutes later - минуты спустя]  bareheaded, leaning back  [leaning back - откидываясь назад] in his Lizzie at a raffish angle, [raffish angle - беспорядочный угол]  his longish hair blowing  [longish hair blowing - длинные волосы развеваются] in the wind, a villainous-looking old black pipe in his mouth, she envied him again. Men had the best of it, no doubt about that. This outlaw happy, [outlaw happy - преступник счастлив]  whatever he was or wasn’t. She, Valancy Stirling, [valancy stirling - валенси стирлинг]  respectable, well-behaved to the last degree, [last degree - последняя степень]  was unhappy and had always been unhappy. So there you were.

Valancy was just in time for supper. The sun had clouded over, and a dismal, drizzling rain  [drizzling rain - моросил дождь] was falling again. Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - кузина Стиклз] had the neuralgia. Valancy had to do the family darning  [family darning - семейная штопка] and there was no time for _Magic of Wings_.

“Can’t the darning wait till tomorrow?” she pleaded.

“Tomorrow will bring its own duties,” said Mrs. Frederick inexorably. [frederick inexorably - фредерик неумолимо] 

Valancy darned  [valancy darned - валэнси штопаная] all the evening and listened to Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles talking  [cousin stickles talking - двоюродная сестра Стиклз говорит] the eternal, niggling gossip  [niggling gossip - придирчивые сплетни] of the clan, as they knitted drearily  [knitted drearily - вязано тоскливо ] at interminable black stockings. [interminable black stockings - бесконечные черные чулки]  They discussed Second Cousin Lilian’ [second cousin lilian - троюродная сестра лилиан] s approaching wedding  [approaching wedding - приближается свадьба] in all its bearings. On the whole, they approved. Second Cousin Lilian was doing well for herself.

“Though she hasn’t hurried,” said Cousin Stickles. “She must be twenty-five.”

“There have not—fortunately—been many old maids  [many old maids - много старых дев] in our connection,” said Mrs. Frederick bitterly. [frederick bitterly - фредерик с горечью] 

Valancy flinched. [valancy flinched - валенси вздрогнула]  She had run the darning needle  [darning needle - штопальная игла] into her finger.

Third Cousin Aaron Gray had been scratched by a cat and had blood-poisoning in his finger. “Cats are most dangerous animals,” said Mrs. Frederick. “I would never  [would never - никогда] have a cat about the house.”

She glared significantly  [glared significantly - многозначительно смотрел] at Valancy through her terrible glasses. [terrible glasses - ужасные очки]  Once, five years ago, [five years ago - пять лет назад]  Valancy had asked if she might have a cat. She had never referred  [never referred - никогда не упоминал] to it since, but Mrs. Frederick still suspected  [frederick still suspected - фредерик все еще подозревал] her of harbouring the unlawful desire  [unlawful desire - незаконное желание] in her heart of hearts.

Once Valancy sneezed. [valancy sneezed - валэнси чихнула]  Now, in the Stirling code, [stirling code - код стирлинга]  it was very bad form  [bad form - плохой тон] to sneeze in public.

“You can always repress  [always repress - всегда подавлять] a sneeze by pressing your finger on your upper lip,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly. [frederick rebukingly - фредерик с упреком] 

Half-past nine  [past nine - девять последних] o’clock and so, as Mr. Pepys would say, [pepys would say - пипс сказал бы]  to bed. But First Cousin Stickles’ neuralgic back must be rubbed with Redfern’s Liniment. Valancy did that. Valancy always  [valancy always - валентность всегда] had to do it. She hated the smell of Redfern’s Liniment—she hated the smug, beaming, portly, be-whiskered, be-spectacled picture  [spectacled picture - картина в очках] of Dr. Redfern on the bottle. Her fingers smelled  [fingers smelled - пахло пальцами] of the horrible stuff  [horrible stuff - ужасные вещи] after she got into bed, in spite of all the scrubbing she gave them.

Valancy’s day of destiny had come and gone. She ended it as she had begun it, in tears.



 CHAPTER VII [chapter vii - глава vii] 

 There was a rosebush on the little Stirling lawn, [little stirling lawn - маленькая лужайка]  growing beside  [growing beside - растущие рядом] the gate. It was called “Doss’s rosebush.” Cousin Georgiana had given it to Valancy five years ago and Valancy had planted it joyfully. She loved roses. [loved roses - любил розы]  But—of course—the rosebush never bloomed. [rosebush never bloomed - розовый куст никогда не цвел]  That was her luck. Valancy did everything she could think  [could think - мог думать] of and took the advice of everybody in the clan, but still the rosebush would  [rosebush would - розовый куст был бы] not bloom. It throve and grew luxuriantly, [grew luxuriantly - буйно росли]  with great leafy branches untouched of rust or spider; but not even a bud had ever appeared  [ever appeared - когда-либо появлялся] on it. Valancy, looking at it two days  [two days - два дня] after her birthday, was filled with a sudden, overwhelming hatred  [overwhelming hatred -  непреодолимая ненависть] for it. The thing wouldn’t bloom: very well, then, she would cut  [would cut - обрезал] it down. She marched to the tool-room in the barn for her garden knife  [garden knife - садовый нож] and she went at the rosebush viciously. [rosebush viciously - розовый куст злобно]  A few minutes later horrified Mrs. Frederick came  [frederick came - приходил Фредерик] out to the verandah and beheld her daughter slashing insanely among the rosebush boughs. [rosebush boughs - ветки розового куста]  Half of them were already strewn  [already strewn - уже разбросаны] on the walk. The bush looked sadly dismantled.

“Doss, what on earth are you doing? Have you gone crazy?”

“No,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - », сказала Валенси]  She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too strong for her. She said it deprecatingly. “I—I just made up my mind to cut this bush down. It is no good. It never blooms—never will bloom.”

“That is no reason for destroying it,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs -  упрямо]  Frederick sternly. [frederick sternly - фредерик повернулся без]  “It was a beautiful bush  [beautiful bush - валэнси знала] and quite ornamental. [quite ornamental - куст один]  You have made a sorry-looking thing  [looking thing - фредерик сохранит] of it.”

“Rose trees should _bloom_,” said Valancy a little obstinately. [little obstinately - три дня] 

“Don’t argue with _me_, Doss. Clear up that mess and leave the bush alone. [bush alone - каменное молчание]  I don’t know what Georgiana will say when she sees how you have hacked it to pieces. Really, I’m surprised at you. And to do it without consulting _me_!”

“The bush is mine,” muttered Valancy.

“What’s that? What did you say, Doss?”

“I only said the bush was mine,” repeated Valancy humbly.

Mrs. Frederick turned without  [frederick turned without - глубоко мать] a word and marched back  [marched back - тощий донор] into the house. The mischief was done now. Valancy knew  [valancy knew - пошла назад] she had offended her mother deeply  [mother deeply - отрубленные ветки] and would not be spoken to or noticed in any way for two or three days. [three days - маленькая кузина Джорджиана]  Cousin Stickles would see to Valancy’s bringing-up but Mrs. Frederick would preserve  [frederick would preserve - оскорбленное величество] the stony silence  [stony silence - валэнси вздохнула] of outraged majesty. [outraged majesty - расползшийся куст] 

Valancy sighed  [valancy sighed -  точный гвоздь] and put away  [put away - убрано] her garden knife, [garden knife - злость чувствуется]  hanging it precisely on its precise nail  [precise nail - », – подумал Валенси] in the tool-shop. She cleared away  [cleared away - двоюродный брат джеймс говорит] the severed branches  [severed branches - губы дернулись] and swept up the leaves. Her lips twitched  [lips twitched - все будет] as she looked at the straggling bush. [straggling bush - странное сходство]  It had an odd resemblance  [odd resemblance - выглядящая вещь] to its shaken, scrawny donor, [scrawny donor - садовый нож]  little Cousin Georgiana  [little cousin georgiana - убрал] herself.

“I certainly have made an awful-looking thing  [looking thing - бедная мать] of it,” thought Valancy. [,” thought valancy - лучше поехать в город] 

But she did not feel repentant—only sorry she had offended her mother. Things would  [things would - знать лучше] be so uncomfortable until she was forgiven. Mrs. Frederick was one of those women who can make their anger felt  [anger felt - валэнси пошла] all over a house. Walls and doors are no protection from it.

“You’d better go uptown  [better go uptown - фиолетовый таблетки] and git the mail,” said Cousin Stickles, when Valancy went  [valancy went - горькая кровь] in. “_I_ can’t go—I feel all sorter peaky  [sorter peaky - горькое право] and piny this spring. I want you to stop at the drugstore and git me a bottle of Redfern’s Blood Bitters. [blood bitters - случайные поверхностные заметки]  There’s nothing like Redfern’s Bitters for building a body up. Cousin James says  [cousin james says - сортировщик пики] the Purple Pills  [purple pills - пошел в город] are the best, but I know better. [know better - всегда останавливаться]  My poor dear husband took Redfern’s Bitters right  [bitters right - бестолковый старый клерк] up to the day he died. Don’t let them charge you more’n ninety cents. I kin git  [kin git - Вэлэнси скорее понравилась] it for that at the Port. And what _have_ you been saying to your poor mother? [poor mother - кин мерзавец]  Do you ever stop  [ever stop - сокрушительные ужасы могут] to think, Doss, that you kin only have one mother?”

“One is enough for me,” thought Valancy undutifully, as she went uptown. [went uptown - едва ли когда-либо попадал] 

Valancy met Uncle Benjamin coming in as she was going out and was glad the letter was safely in her bag.

“What,” said Uncle Benjamin, “is the difference between a donkey and a postage-stamp?”

“I don’t know. What?” answered Valancy dutifully.

“One you lick with a stick and the other you stick with a lick. Ha, ha!”

Uncle Benjamin passed  [uncle benjamin passed - дядя бенджамин прошел] in, tremendously pleased  [tremendously pleased - чрезвычайно доволен] with himself.

Cousin Stickles pounced  [cousin stickles pounced - кузен стиклз набросился] on the _Times_ when Valancy got home, [valancy got home - валэнси вернулась домой]  but it did not occur to her to ask if there were any letters. Mrs. Frederick would  [frederick would - фредерик будет] have asked it, but Mrs. Frederick’s lips at present were sealed. Valancy was glad of this. If her mother had asked if there were any letters Valancy would  [letters valancy would - письма вэлэнси будет] have had to admit there was. Then she would have had to let her mother and Cousin Stickles read  [cousin stickles read - кузен стиклс читал] the letter and all would be discovered.

Her heart acted strangely  [heart acted strangely - сердце вело себя странно] on the way upstairs, [way upstairs - наверху]  and she sat down by her window for a few minutes before opening her letter. She felt very guilty and deceitful. She had never before kept a letter secret  [letter secret -  секретное письмо] from her mother. Every letter  [every letter - каждое письмо] she had ever written  [ever written - когда-либо написанное] or received had been read by Mrs. Frederick. That had never mattered. [never mattered - никогда не имело значения]  Valancy had never had anything to hide. But this _did_ matter. She could not have any one see  [one see - один видишь] this letter. But her fingers trembled  [fingers trembled - пальцы дрожали] with a consciousness of wickedness and unfilial conduct  [unfilial conduct - недочернее поведение] as she opened it—trembled a little, too, perhaps, with apprehension. She felt quite sure  [felt quite sure - чувствовал себя вполне уверенно] there was nothing seriously wrong  [nothing seriously wrong - ничего серьезного] with her heart but—one never knew.

Dr. Trent’s letter was like himself—blunt, abrupt, concise, wasting no words. Dr. Trent never beat  [trent never beat - трент никогда не бил] about the bush. “Dear Miss Sterling”—and then a page of black, positive writing. [positive writing - позитивное письмо]  Valancy seemed  [valancy seemed - валентность казалась] to read it at a glance; she dropped it on her lap, her face ghost- [face ghost - лицо-призрак] white.

Dr. Trent told  [trent told - трент сказал] her that she had a very dangerous and fatal form  [fatal form - смертельная форма] of heart disease—angina pectoris—evidently complicated with an aneurism—whatever that was—and in the last stages. [last stages - последние стадии]  He said, without mincing matters, [without mincing matters - без обиняков]  that nothing could  [nothing could - ничего не может] be done for her. If she took great care  [great care - большая осторожность]  [took great care - взял большая осторожность] of herself she might live  [might live - может выжить] a year—but she might also die  [might also die - может также умереть] at any moment—Dr. Trent never troubled  [trent never troubled - трент никогда не беспокоился] himself about euphemisms. She must be careful to avoid all excitement and all severe muscular efforts. [severe muscular efforts - сильные мускульные усилия]  She must eat  [must eat - должен есть] and drink moderately, [drink moderately - пить умеренно]  she must never run, [must never run - никогда не должен бежать]  she must go upstairs  [must go upstairs - должен подняться наверх] and uphill with great care. Any sudden jolt  [sudden jolt - внезапный толчок] or shock might  [shock might - шок может] be fatal. She was to get the prescription he enclosed filled  [enclosed filled - закрыто заполнено] and carry it with her always, taking a dose whenever  [dose whenever - доза всякий раз] her attacks came  [attacks came - приступы приступов] on. And he was hers truly, H. B. Trent.

Valancy sat  [valancy sat - валэнси сидел] for a long while by her window. Outside was a world drowned  [world drowned - мир утонул] in the light of a spring afternoon—skies entrancingly blue, winds perfumed  [winds perfumed - ветры ароматизированы ] and free, lovely, soft, blue hazes  [blue hazes - голубая дымка] at the end of every street. [every street - каждая улица]  Over at the railway station  [railway station - железнодорожный вокзал] a group of young girls  [young girls - молодые девушки] was waiting for a train; she heard their gay laughter  [gay laughter - веселый смех] as they chattered and joked. The train roared  [train roared - поезд ревел] in and roared out again. But none of these things had any reality. Nothing had any reality except  [reality except - реальность кроме] the fact that she had only another year  [another year - еще один год] to live.

When she was tired of sitting at the window she went over and lay down on her bed, staring at the cracked, discoloured ceiling. [discoloured ceiling - обесцвеченный потолок]  The curious numbness  [curious numbness - любопытное оцепенение] that follows on a staggering blow possessed  [staggering blow possessed - ошеломляющий удар овладел] her. She did not feel anything except  [feel anything except - чувствую что угодно, кроме] a boundless surprise  [boundless surprise - безграничное удивление ] and incredulity—behind which was the conviction that Dr. Trent knew  [trent knew - трент знал] his business and that she, Valancy Stirling, [valancy stirling - валэнси стирлинг]  who had never lived, [never lived - никогда не жил]  was about to die.

When the gong rang  [gong rang - звонил гонг] for supper Valancy got  [supper valancy got - ужин вэлэнси получил] up and went downstairs mechanically, [went downstairs mechanically - машинально спустился вниз]  from force of habit. She wondered that she had been let alone  [let alone - не говоря уже о] so long. But of course her mother would  [mother would - мать бы] not pay any attention to her just now. Valancy was thankful for this. She thought the quarrel over the rosebush had been really, as Mrs. Frederick herself might have said, Providential. She could not eat anything, [eat anything - съел что-нибудь]  but both Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles thought  [cousin stickles thought - двоюродный брат застрял в мыслях] this was because she was deservedly unhappy  [deservedly unhappy - заслуженно несчастный] over her mother’s attitude, and her lack of appetite was not commented on. Valancy forced  [valancy forced - вэланси заставили] herself to swallow a cup of tea and then sat and watched the others eat, [others eat - другие едят]  with an odd feeling  [odd feeling - странное чувство] that years had passed since  [passed since - прошло с тех пор, как] she had sat with them at the dinner-table. She found herself smiling inwardly  [smiling inwardly - внутренне улыбаться] to think what a commotion she could make  [could make -  мог бы заставить] if she chose. Let her merely tell  [merely tell - просто сказала] them what was in Dr. Trent’s letter and there would be as much fuss made  [much fuss made - слишком много шума поднял] as if—Valancy thought bitterly—they really cared two straws about her.

“Dr. Trent’s housekeeper got word  [housekeeper got word - экономка получила слово] from him today,” said Cousin Stickles, so suddenly that Valancy jumped guiltily. [valancy jumped guiltily - валэнси виновато подпрыгнуть]  Was there anything in thought waves? [thought waves - волны мыслей]  “Mrs. Judd was talking to her uptown. They think his son will recover, but Dr. Trent wrote  [trent wrote - трент написал] that if he did he was going to take him abroad as soon as he was able to travel and wouldn’t be back here for a year at least.”

“That will not matter much  [matter much - значительно] to _us_,” said Mrs. Frederick majestically. [frederick majestically - фредерик величественно]  “He is not _our_ doctor. I would not”—here she looked or seemed to look accusingly right  [look accusingly right - выглядеть обвинительно правильно] through Valancy—“have _him_ to doctor a sick cat.”

“May I go upstairs  [go upstairs - подняться наверх] and lie down?” said Valancy faintly. “I—I have a headache.”

“What has given you a headache?” asked Cousin Stickles, since Mrs. [since mrs - с тех пор, как миссис]  Frederick would  [frederick would - фредерик ] not. The question had to be asked. Valancy could  [valancy could - валэнси могла] not be allowed to have headaches without interference. [headaches without interference - головные боли без помех] 

“You ain’t in the habit of having headaches. I hope you’re not taking the mumps. Here, try a spoonful of vinegar.”

“Piffle!” said Valancy rudely, getting up from the table. She did not care just then if she were rude. She had had to be so polite all her life.

If it had been possible for Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат палочки] to turn pale  [turn pale - побледнела] she would have. As it was not, she turned yellower. [turned yellower - пожелтела] 

“Are you sure you ain’t feverish, Doss? You sound like  [sound like - похоже на] it. You go and get right  [get right - правильно] into bed,” said Cousin Stickles, thoroughly alarmed, [thoroughly alarmed - полностью встревожены]  “and I’ll come up and rub your forehead and the back of your neck with Redfern’s Liniment.”

Valancy had reached the door, but she turned. “I won’t be rubbed with Redfern’s Liniment!” she said.

Cousin Stickles stared  [cousin stickles stared - двоюродный брат Стиклз уставился] and gasped. “What—what do you mean?”

“I said I wouldn’t be rubbed with Redfern’s Liniment,” repeated Valancy. “Horrid, sticky stuff! [sticky stuff - липкое вещество]  And it has the vilest smell  [vilest smell - отвратительный запах] of any liniment I ever saw. [ever saw - когда-либо видел]  It’s no good. I want to be left alone, [left alone - оставленный в покое]  that’s all.”

Valancy went  [valancy went - валэнси ушла] out, leaving Cousin Stickles aghast.

“She’s feverish—she _must_ be feverish,” ejaculated Cousin Stickles.

Mrs. Frederick went  [frederick went - фредерик] on eating her supper. It did not matter whether Valancy  [matter whether valancy - независимо от того, ушла ли вэлэнси] was or was not feverish. Valancy had been guilty of impertinence to _her_.



 CHAPTER VIII [chapter viii - глава viii] 

 Valancy did not sleep that night. She lay awake  [lay awake - не спать] all through the long dark hours—thinking—thinking. She made a discovery that surprised her: she, who had been afraid of almost everything  [almost everything - почти все] in life, was not afraid of death. It did not seem in the least terrible  [least terrible - наименее ужасно] to her. And she need not now be afraid of anything else. [anything else - что-нибудь еще]  Why had she been afraid of things? Because of life. Afraid of Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] because of the menace of poverty in old age. [old age - старость]  But now she would never  [would never - никогда бы] be old—neglected—tolerated. Afraid of being an old maid  [old maid - старый служанка] all her life. But now she would not be an old maid very long. Afraid of offending her mother and her clan because she had to live with and among them and couldn’t live peaceably  [live peaceably - жить мирно] if she didn’t give in to them. But now she hadn’t. Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валэнси войлок] a curious freedom. [curious freedom - любопытная свобода] 

But she was still horribly afraid  [still horribly afraid - до сих пор ужасно боюсь] of one thing—the fuss the whole jamfry  [whole jamfry - весь джемфрай] of them would make  [would make - заставит] when she told them. Valancy shuddered  [valancy shuddered - валэнси содрогнулась] at the thought of it. She couldn’t endure it. Oh, she knew so well how it would be. First there would be indignation—yes, indignation on the part of Uncle James  [uncle james - дядя джеймс] because she had gone to a doctor—any doctor—without consulting HIM. Indignation on the part of her mother for being so sly and deceitful—“to your own mother, Doss.” Indignation on the part of the whole clan  [whole clan - весь клан] because she had not gone to Dr. Marsh.

It was this last thought  [last thought - последняя мысль] that really decided Valancy. [really decided valancy - действительно решил, что валентность]  She could not put up with it and she wouldn’t. As the clock in the hall below struck twelve Valancy suddenly and definitely made  [definitely made - определенно сделано] up her mind that she would not tell anybody. [tell anybody - скажет кому-нибудь]  She had always been told, ever since  [ever since - с тех пор] she could remember, [could remember - мог вспомнить]  that she must hide  [must hide - должен скрыть] her feelings. “It is not ladylike to have feelings,” Cousin Stickles had once told her disapprovingly. Well, she would hide  [would hide - скроет] them with a vengeance.

But though she was not afraid of death she was not indifferent to it. She found that she _resented_ it; it was not fair that she should have to die when she had never lived. [never lived - никогда не жил]  Rebellion flamed  [rebellion flamed - восстание пылало] up in her soul as the dark hours passed  [dark hours passed - темные часы прошли] by—not because she had no future but because she had no past.

“I’m poor—I’m ugly—I’m a failure—and I’m near death,” she thought. She could see  [could see - мог видеть] her own obituary notice  [obituary notice - некролог] in the Deerwood _Weekly Times_, copied into the Port Lawrence _Journal_. “A deep gloom  [deep gloom - глубокий мрак] was cast over Deerwood, etc., etc.”—“leaves a large circle  [large circle - большой круг] of friends to mourn, etc., etc., etc.”—lies, all lies. Gloom, forsooth! Nobody would miss  [nobody would miss - никто бы не пропустил] her. Her death would  [death would - смерть бы] not matter a straw to anybody. Not even her mother loved  [mother loved - мать любила ] her—her mother who had been so disappointed that she was not a boy—or at least, a pretty girl. [pretty girl - красотка] 

Valancy reviewed  [valancy reviewed - оценка валентности] her whole life  [whole life - вся жизнь] between midnight and the early spring dawn. [early spring dawn - ранний весенний рассвет]  It was a very drab existence, [drab existence - серое существование]  but here and there an incident loomed  [incident loomed - вырисовывался инцидент] out with a significance out of all proportion to its real importance. [real importance - реальная важность]  These incidents were all unpleasant in one way  [one way - в одну сторону] or another. Nothing really pleasant  [nothing really pleasant - ничего особенно приятного] had ever happened  [ever happened - когда-либо случалось] to Valancy.

“I’ve never had one wholly happy hour in my life—not one,” she thought. “I’ve just been a colourless nonentity. [colourless nonentity - бесцветный ничтожество]  I remember reading somewhere  [remember reading somewhere - помните, что где-то читал] once that there is an hour in which a woman might  [woman might - женщина могла] be happy all her life if she could but find it. I’ve never found  [never found - никогда не находил] my hour—never, never. And I never will now. If I could only have had that hour I’d be willing to die.”

Those significant incidents kept bobbing up in her mind like unbidden ghosts, without any sequence of time or place. For instance, that time when, at sixteen, she had blued a tubful of clothes too deeply. And the time when, at eight, she had “stolen” some raspberry jam  [raspberry jam - малиновое варенье] from Aunt Wellington’s pantry. Valancy never heard  [valancy never heard - валентность никогда не слышал] the last of those two misdemeanours. [two misdemeanours - два проступка]  At almost every clan gathering they were raked up against her as jokes. Uncle Benjamin hardly ever missed re-telling the raspberry jam incident—he had been the one to catch her, her face all stained and streaked.

“I have really done  [really done - действительно сделано] so few bad things  [bad things - плохие вещи] that they have to keep harping  [keep harping - продолжать твердить] on the old ones,” thought Valancy. “Why, I’ve never even  [never even - даже никогда] had a quarrel with any one. I haven’t an enemy. What a spineless thing  [spineless thing - бесхребетность] I must be not to have even one enemy!”

There was that incident of the dust-pile at school when she was seven. Valancy always recalled  [valancy always recalled - валэнси всегда вспоминают] it when Dr. Stalling referred  [stalling referred - школа пылит] to the text, “To him that hath shall  [hath shall - пылит больше] be given and from him that hath not shall be taken even  [taken even - чрезвычайно красивая девушка] that which he hath.” Other people might puzzle  [people might puzzle - люди могут озадачить] over that text but it never puzzled Valancy. [never puzzled valancy - никогда не озадачивалась ]  The whole relationship  [whole relationship - достаточно большая] between herself and Olive, dating from the day of the dust-pile, was a commentary on it.

She had been going to school a year, but Olive, who was a year younger, [year younger - девушки постарше]  had just begun and had about her all the glamour of “a new girl” and an exceedingly pretty girl  [exceedingly pretty girl - на год моложе] at that. It was at recess and all the girls, big and little, were out on the road in front of the school making dust- [making dust - внезапно обнаруживается]  [school making dust - валэнси войлок] piles. The aim of each girl was to have the biggest pile. [biggest pile - руки раскинутая]  Valancy was good at making dust-piles—there was an art in it—and she had secret hopes  [secret hopes - набросилась на большую девушку] of leading. But Olive, working off by herself, was suddenly discovered  [suddenly discovered - безжалостно отметается] to have a larger dust- [larger dust - тайные надежды] pile than anybody. Valancy felt  [valancy felt - самая большая куча] no jealousy. Her dust-pile was quite big enough  [quite big enough - пыль побольше] to please her. Then one of the older girls  [older girls - протянула маленькие ручки] had an inspiration.

“Let’s put all our dust on Olive’s pile and make a tremendous one,” she exclaimed.

A frenzy seemed  [frenzy seemed - мольба осталась без внимания] to seize the girls. They swooped down on the dust-piles with pails and shovels and in a few seconds Olive’s pile was a veritable pyramid. [veritable pyramid - безумие казалось]  In vain Valancy, [vain valancy - пылинка]  with scrawny, outstretched little arms, [outstretched little arms - напрасная валенсия]  tried to protect hers. She was ruthlessly swept aside, [ruthlessly swept aside - настоящая пирамида]  her dust-pile scooped  [pile scooped - валэнси отвернулась] up and poured on Olive’s. Valancy turned away resolutely and began building another dust-pile. Again a bigger girl pounced  [bigger girl pounced - валанси стояла] on it. Valancy stood  [valancy stood - девушка постарше] before it, flushed, indignant, arms outspread. [arms outspread - куча зачерпнута] 

“Don’t take it,” she pleaded. “Please don’t take it.”

“But _why_?” demanded the older girl. [older girl - сердце распухло]  “Why won’t you help to build Olive’s bigger?”

“I want my own little dust- [little dust - глаза полны] pile,” said Valancy piteously.

Her plea went unheeded. [plea went unheeded - последний раз валэнси]  While she argued with one girl another scraped up her dust-pile. Valancy turned away, [valancy turned away - девочки насмешливо]  her heart swelling, [heart swelling - валенси рассказала]  her eyes full  [eyes full - матери холодно] of tears.

“Jealous—you’re jealous!” said the girls mockingly. [girls mockingly -  когда-либо взятый] 

“You were very selfish,” said her mother coldly, [mother coldly - тайная душа]  when Valancy told  [valancy told - все дело] her about it at night. That was the first and last time Valancy  [last time valancy - валэнси никогда не забывала] had ever taken  [ever taken - ни ревнивые] any of her troubles to her mother.

Valancy was neither jealous  [neither jealous - большое значение] nor selfish. It was only that she wanted a dust-pile of her own—small or big mattered  [big mattered - сверхъестественный ужас] not. A team of horses came  [horses came - видел восход справа] down the street—Olive’s dust pile  [dust pile - огромная красная луна] was scattered over the roadway—the bell rang—the girls trooped  [girls trooped - ужасная яркая луна] into school and had forgotten the whole affair  [whole affair - девушки толпами] before they reached their seats. Valancy never forgot  [valancy never forgot - лошади не пришли] it. To this day she resented it in her secret soul. [secret soul - куча пыли]  But was it not symbolical of her life?

“I’ve never been able to have my own dust-pile,” thought Valancy.

The enormous red moon  [enormous red moon - могут смотри] she had seen rising right  [seen rising right - ужас, как бы] at the end of the street one autumn evening of her sixth year. [sixth year - когда-либо пробовала]  She had been sick and cold with the awful, uncanny horror  [uncanny horror - четырнадцать лет спустя] of it. So near to her. So big. She had run in trembling to her mother and her mother had laughed at her. She had gone to bed and hidden her face under the clothes in terror lest  [terror lest - валэнси найдена] she might look  [might look - никто не поверит] at the window and see that horrible moon glaring  [horrible moon glaring - шестикурсники] in at her through it.

The boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen. She had not let him—she had evaded him and run. He was the only boy who had ever tried  [ever tried - поцелуй оливку] to kiss her. Now, fourteen years later, [fourteen years later - валэнси знала]  Valancy found  [valancy found - сегодня вечером душа] herself wishing that she had let him.

The time she had been made to apologise to Olive for something she hadn’t done. Olive had said that Valancy had pushed her into the mud and spoiled her new shoes _on purpose_. Valancy knew  [valancy knew - когда-либо хотела что-нибудь] she hadn’t. It had been an accident—and even that wasn’t her fault—but nobody would believe  [nobody would believe - маленькие бантики из лент] her. She had to apologise—and kiss Olive  [kiss olive - мысль оливкового] to “make up.” The injustice of it burned in her soul tonight. [soul tonight - кремово-желтая сетка] 

That summer when Olive had the most beautiful hat, [beautiful hat - много воскресений Валэнси]  trimmed with creamy yellow net, [creamy yellow net - вырезать сзади]  with a wreath of red roses  [red roses - , подумал Валенси] and little ribbon bows  [little ribbon bows - красные розы] under the chin. Valancy had wanted a hat like  [hat like - отличная фольга] that more than she had ever wanted anything. [ever wanted anything - как шляпа]  She pleaded for one and had been laughed at—all summer she had to wear a horrid little brown sailor with elastic that cut behind  [cut behind - никогда не застревал] her ears. None of the girls would go around with her because she was so shabby—nobody but Olive. People had thought Olive  [thought olive - красиво шляпа] so sweet and unselfish.

“I was an excellent foil  [excellent foil - оставайся дома] for her,” thought Valancy. [,” thought valancy - воскресная школа]  “Even then she knew that.”

Valancy had tried to win a prize for attendance in Sunday School  [sunday school - чрезвычайно плохое поведение] once. But Olive won it. There were so many Sundays Valancy  [many sundays valancy - двенадцать лет] had to stay home  [stay home - тетя Изабель] because she had colds. She had once tried to “say a piece” in school one Friday afternoon and had broken down in it. Olive was a good reciter  [good reciter - тонкая рука] and never got stuck. [never got stuck - хороший чтец] 

The time Cousin Betty Stirling was married. Somehow Valancy got wind of the fact that Betty was going to ask her to be one of her bridesmaids. Valancy was secretly uplifted. [secretly uplifted - тайно приподнялся]  It would be a delightful thing  [delightful thing - восхитительная вещь] to be a bridesmaid. And of course she would have to have a new dress  [new dress - новое платье] for it—a pretty new dress—a pink dress. [pink dress - розовое платье]  Betty wanted  [betty wanted - Бетти разыскивается] her bridesmaids to dress in pink.

But Betty had never asked  [never asked - никогда не спрашивал] her, after all. Valancy couldn’t guess why, but long after her secret tears  [secret tears - тайные слезы] of disappointment had been dried Olive told  [dried olive told - высушенные оливки сказали] her. Betty, after much consultation  [much consultation - много консультаций] and reflection, had decided that Valancy was too insignificant—she would “spoil the effect.” That was nine years ago. [nine years ago - девять лет назад]  But tonight Valancy caught  [tonight valancy caught - сегодня поймали валентинку] her breath with the old pain  [old pain - старая боль] and sting of it.

That day in her eleventh year  [eleventh year - одиннадцатый год] when her mother had badgered her into confessing something  [confessing something - признается в чем-то] she had never done. [never done - никогда не делал ]  Valancy had denied it for a long time  [long time - долгое время] but eventually for peace’ sake she had given in and pleaded guilty. [pleaded guilty - признал себя виновным]  Mrs. Frederick was always making people lie by pushing them into situations where they _had_ to lie. Then her mother had made her kneel down on the parlour floor, [parlour floor - пол в гостиной]  between herself and Cousin Stickles, [cousin stickles - двоюродная сестра]  and say, “O God, please forgive  [please forgive - пожалуйста, прости] me for not speaking the truth.” Valancy had said it, but as she rose from her knees she muttered. “But, O God, _you_ know I did speak the truth.” Valancy had not then heard of Galileo but her fate was similar to his. She was punished just as severely as if she hadn’t confessed and prayed.

The winter she went to dancing-school. Uncle James  [uncle james - дядя джеймс] had decreed she should go and had paid for her lessons. How she had looked forward  [looked forward - с нетерпением ждал] to it! And how she had hated it! She had never had a voluntary partner. [voluntary partner - добровольный партнер]  The teacher always  [teacher always - учитель всегда] had to tell some boy to dance with her, and generally he had been sulky about it. Yet Valancy  [yet valancy - пока валентность] was a good dancer, [good dancer - хороший танцор]  as light on her feet as thistledown. Olive, who never lacked eager partners, was heavy.

The affair of the button-string, when she was ten. All the girls in school had button-strings. Olive had a very long one  [long one - долгое] with a great many beautiful buttons. [beautiful buttons - красивые пуговицы]  Valancy had one. Most of the buttons on it were very commonplace, but she had six beauties  [six beauties - шесть красоток] that had come off Grandmother Stirling’s wedding-gown—sparkling buttons of gold and glass, much more beautiful than any Olive had. Their possession conferred  [possession conferred - владение даровано] a certain distinction  [certain distinction - определенное отличие] on Valancy. She knew every little girl in school envied  [school envied - школа завидовала] her the exclusive possession  [exclusive possession - исключительное владение] of those beautiful buttons. When Olive saw  [olive saw - оливковая пила] them on the button-string she had looked at them narrowly but said nothing—then. The next day Aunt Wellington  [aunt wellington - тетя веллингтон] had come to Elm Street  [elm street - улица вязов] and told Mrs. [told mrs - сказала миссис]  Frederick that she thought Olive  [thought olive - мыслила оливия ] should have some of those buttons—Grandmother Stirling was just as much Wellington’s mother as Frederick’s. Mrs. Frederick had agreed amiably. [agreed amiably - дружелюбно согласились]  She could not afford to fall out with Aunt Wellington. Moreover, the matter was of no importance whatever. [importance whatever - важность какая-то]  Aunt Wellington carried  [aunt wellington carried - тетя веллингтон несла] off four of the buttons, generously leaving two  [generously leaving two - великодушно оставляя двоих] for Valancy. Valancy had torn these from her string and flung them on the floor—she had not yet learned  [yet learned - пока узнала] that it was unladylike to have feelings—and had been sent supperless  [sent supperless - послали без ужина] to bed for the exhibition.

The night of Margaret Blunt’s party. She had made such pathetic efforts  [pathetic efforts - жалкие усилия] to be pretty that night. Rob Walker  [rob walker - роб уокер] was to be there; and two nights  [two nights - две ночи] before, on the moonlit verandah  [moonlit verandah - залитая лунным светом веранда] of Uncle Herbert’s cottage at Mistawis, Rob had really seemed attracted  [really seemed attracted - действительно казались привлекательными] to her. At Margaret’s party Rob never even asked her to dance—did not notice her at all. She was a wallflower, as usual. That, of course, was years ago. [years ago - годы назад]  People in Deerwood had long since given  [long since given - давно дана] up inviting Valancy  [inviting valancy - манящая вэлэнси ] to dances. But to Valancy its humiliation and disappointment were of the other day. Her face burned  [face burned - лицо обожжено] in the darkness as she recalled herself, sitting there with her pitifully crimped, [pitifully crimped - жалко сморщенный]  thin hair  [thin hair - тонкие волосы] and the cheeks she had pinched for an hour before coming, in an effort to make them red. All that came of it was a wild story  [wild story - дикая история] that Valancy Stirling  [valancy stirling - валэнси стирлинг] was rouged at Margaret Blunt’s party. In those days in Deerwood that was enough to wreck your character forever. [character forever - характер навсегда]  It did not wreck Valancy’s, or even damage  [even damage - даже ущерб] it. People knew _she_ couldn’t be fast if she tried. They only laughed at her.

“I’ve had nothing but a second-hand existence,” decided Valancy. “All the great emotions  [great emotions -  великие эмоции] of life have passed me by. I’ve never even  [never even - даже никогда] had a grief. And have I ever really loved anybody? Do I really love Mother? [really love mother - очень люблю мать]  No, I don’t. That’s the truth, whether it is disgraceful or not. I don’t love her—I’ve never loved  [never loved - никогда не любил] her. What’s worse, I don’t even like  [even like - даже как] her. So I don’t know anything  [know anything - ничего не знаю] about any kind of love. My life has been empty—empty. Nothing is worse than emptiness. Nothing!” Valancy ejaculated the last “nothing” aloud passionately. Then she moaned and stopped thinking  [stopped thinking - перестал думать] about anything for a while. One of her attacks of pain had come on.

When it was over something had happened to Valancy—perhaps the culmination of the process that had been going on in her mind ever since  [mind ever since - разум с тех пор] she had read Dr. [read dr - прочитайте доктора]  Trent’s letter. It was three o’clock in the morning—the wisest and most accursed hour  [accursed hour - проклятый час] of the clock. But sometimes it sets us free. [sets us free - освобождает нас] 

“I’ve been trying to please other people all my life and failed,” she said. “After this I shall please  [shall please - пожалуйста] myself. I shall never pretend anything again. I’ve breathed an atmosphere of fibs and pretences and evasions all my life. What a luxury it will be to tell the truth! I may not be able to do much that I want to do but I won’t do another thing  [another thing - еще одну вещь] that I don’t want to do. Mother can pout for weeks—I shan’t worry over it. ‘Despair is a free man—hope is a slave.’”

Valancy got  [valancy got - валенси получила] up and dressed, with a deepening of that curious sense  [curious sense - любопытный смысл] of freedom. When she had finished with her hair she opened the window and hurled the jar of potpourri over into the next lot. [next lot - следующая партия]  It smashed gloriously  [smashed gloriously - великолепно разбита] against the schoolgirl complexion  [schoolgirl complexion - цвет лица школьницы] on the old carriage- [old carriage - старая карета] shop.

“I’m sick of the fragrance of dead things,” said Valancy.



 CHAPTER IX [chapter ix - глава ix] 

 Uncle Herbert  [uncle herbert - дядя герберт] and Aunt Alberta’s silver wedding  [silver wedding -  серебряная свадьба] was delicately referred  [delicately referred - деликатно упомянутый] to among the Stirlings during the following weeks  [following weeks - последующие недели] as “the time we first noticed poor Valancy was—a little—you understand?”

Not for worlds would  [worlds would - миры бы] any of the Stirlings have said out and out at first that Valancy had gone mildly insane  [gone mildly insane - сошел с ума] or even that her mind was slightly deranged. [slightly deranged - слегка ненормальный]  Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] was considered to have gone entirely  [gone entirely - ушел полностью] too far when he had ejaculated, “She’s dippy—I tell you, she’s dippy,” and was only excused because of the outrageousness of Valancy’s conduct at the aforesaid wedding dinner. [aforesaid wedding dinner - вышеупомянутый свадебный ужин] 

But Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - кузен Стиклс] had noticed a few things that made them uneasy _before_ the dinner. It had begun with the rosebush, of course; and Valancy never  [valancy never - валэнси никогда] was really “quite right” again. She did not seem to worry in the least over the fact that her mother was not speaking to her. You would never suppose  [would never suppose - никогда бы не подумал] she noticed it at all. She had flatly refused  [flatly refused - категорически отказался] to take either Purple Pills or Redfern’s Bitters. She had announced coolly  [announced coolly - объявил хладнокровно] that she did not intend to answer to the name of “Doss” any longer. She had told Cousin Stickles  [told cousin stickles - сказал двоюродному брату Стиклсу] that she wished she would give  [would give - отдал бы] up wearing that brooch with Cousin Artemas Stickles’ hair in it. She had moved her bed in her room to the opposite corner. [opposite corner - противоположное угол]  She had read _Magic of Wings_ Sunday afternoon. When Cousin Stickles had rebuked her Valancy had said indifferently, [said indifferently - сказал равнодушно]  “Oh, I forgot it was Sunday”—and _had gone on reading it_.

Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат Стиклс] had seen a terrible thing—she had caught Valancy sliding  [caught valancy sliding - поймал, что валэнси скользит] down the bannister. Cousin Stickles did not tell Mrs. [tell mrs - скажи миссис]  Frederick this—poor Amelia was worried enough  [worried enough - достаточно обеспокоен] as it was. But it was Valancy’s announcement on Saturday night  [saturday night - субботний вечер] that she was not going to go to the Anglican church  [anglican church - англиканская церковь] any more that broke through Mrs. Frederick’s stony silence. [stony silence - каменное молчание] 

“Not going to church any more! Doss, have you absolutely taken leave——”

“Oh, I’m going to church,” said Valancy airily. “I’m going to the Presbyterian church. [presbyterian church - пресвитерианская церковь]  But to the Anglican church  [anglican church - англиканская церковь] I will not go.”

This was even worse. [even worse - еще хуже]  Mrs. Frederick had recourse to tears, having found outraged majesty  [found outraged majesty - обнаружили возмущенное величество] had ceased to be effective.

“What have you got against the Anglican church?” she sobbed.

“Nothing—only just that you’ve always made  [always made - всегда сделано] me go there. If you’d made me go to the Presbyterian church  [presbyterian church - пресвитерианская церковь] I’d want to go to the Anglican.”

“Is that a nice thing  [nice thing - хорошо вещь] to say to your mother? Oh, how true it is that it is sharper than a serpent’s tooth to have a thankless child.”

“Is that a nice thing  [nice thing - хорошая вещь] to say to your daughter?” said unrepentant Valancy.

So Valancy’s behaviour at the silver wedding  [silver wedding - серебряная свадьба] was not quite the surprise to Mrs. Frederick and Christine Stickles  [christine stickles - кристина палочка] that it was to the rest. They were doubtful about the wisdom of taking her, but concluded it would “make talk” if they didn’t. Perhaps she would behave  [would behave - будет вести себя] herself, and so far no outsider suspected  [outsider suspected - подозревается посторонний] there was anything queer  [anything queer - что-нибудь странное] about her. By a special mercy  [special mercy - особая милость] of Providence it had poured torrents Sunday morning, so Valancy had not carried out her hideous threat  [hideous threat - отвратительная угроза] of going to the Presbyterian church. [presbyterian church - пресвитерианская церковь] 

“Put on your brown silk dress,” said Mrs. Stirling.

As if there were anything else  [anything else - что угодно еще] to put on! Valancy had only the one festive dress—that snuffy-brown silk  [brown silk - коричневый шелк] Aunt Isabel  [aunt isabel - тетя изабель] had given her. Aunt Isabel had decreed that Valancy should never wear colours. [never wear colours - никогда не носите цвета]  They did not become her. When she was young they allowed her to wear white, [wear white - носите белое]  but that had been tacitly dropped  [tacitly dropped - молчаливо опускается] for some years. Valancy put  [valancy put - валанс надевается] on the brown silk. It had a high collar  [high collar - высокий воротник] and long sleeves. [long sleeves - длинные рукава]  She had never had a dress with low neck  [low neck - низкий вырез] and elbow sleeves, [elbow sleeves - рукава до локтя]  although they had been worn, even in Deerwood, for over a year. But she did not do her hair pompadour. [hair pompadour - помпадур для волос]  She knotted it on her neck and pulled it out over her ears. She thought it became her—only the little knot  [little knot - небольшой узел] was so absurdly small. [absurdly small - абсурдно маленький]  Mrs. Frederick resented  [frederick resented - фредерик возмущен] the hair but decided it was wisest to say nothing  [say nothing - ни слова] on the eve of the party. It was so important that Valancy should be kept in good humour, [good humour - хороший юмор]  if possible, until it was over. Mrs. Frederick did not reflect that this was the first time  [first time - первый раз] in her life that she had thought it necessary to consider Valancy’s humours. But then Valancy had never been “queer” before.

On their way to Uncle Herbert’s—Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles walking  [cousin stickles walking - двоюродный брат с трудом ходит] in front, Valancy trotting meekly along behind—Roaring Abel drove past them. Drunk as usual but not in the roaring stage. [roaring stage - ревущая сцена]  Just drunk enough  [drunk enough - достаточно пьяный] to be excessively polite. [excessively polite - чрезмерно вежливый]  He raised his disreputable old tartan cap with the air of a monarch saluting  [monarch saluting - монарх салютует] his subjects and swept them a grand bow. [grand bow - великолепный поклон]  Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles dared  [cousin stickles dared - кузен осмелился] not cut Roaring Abel altogether. He was the only person in Deerwood who could be got to do odd jobs  [odd jobs - случайные работы] of carpentering and repairing when they needed to be done, so it would not do to offend him. But they responded with only the stiffest, slightest of bows. Roaring Abel must  [roaring abel must - ревущий авель должен] be kept in his place.

Valancy, behind them, did a thing they were fortunately spared seeing. [fortunately spared seeing - к счастью, не увидел]  She smiled gaily  [smiled gaily - весело улыбался] and waved her hand to Roaring Abel. [roaring abel - ревущий авель]  Why not? She had always liked  [always liked - всегда любил] the old sinner. [old sinner - старый грешник]  He was such a jolly, picturesque, unashamed reprobate  [unashamed reprobate - бесстыдный нечестивец] and stood out against the drab respectability  [drab respectability - унылая респектабельность] of Deerwood and its customs like  [customs like - нравы как] a flame-red flag  [red flag - красный флаг] of revolt and protest. Only a few nights ago Abel  [nights ago abel - несколько ночей назад абеля ] had gone through Deerwood in the wee sma’s, shouting oaths  [shouting oaths - выкрикивая клятвы] at the top of his stentorian voice  [stentorian voice - зычный голос] which could be heard for miles, and lashing his horse into a furious gallop  [furious gallop - яростный галоп] as he tore along prim, [tore along prim - мчался по чопорной]  proper Elm Street. [proper elm street - настоящей улице вязов] 

“Yelling and blaspheming like  [blaspheming like - кощунственный как] a fiend,” shuddered Cousin Stickles at the breakfast-table.

“I cannot understand  [cannot understand - ревущий авель] why the judgment of the Lord has not fallen upon  [fallen upon - внезапное товарищеское чувство] that man long ere  [man long ere - человек давным-давно] this,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs -  напоминание]  Frederick petulantly, [frederick petulantly - не могу понять]  as if she thought Providence  [thought providence - фридерик раздраженно] was very dilatory and ought to have a gentle reminder. [gentle reminder - напал на] 

“He’ll be picked up dead some morning—he’ll fall under his horse’s hoofs and be trampled to death,” said Cousin Stickles reassuringly.

Valancy had said nothing, [said nothing - чуть не упал]  of course; but she wondered to herself if Roaring Abel’ [roaring abel - периодические загулы] s periodical sprees  [periodical sprees - бесполезный протест] were not his futile protest  [futile protest - голубой замок] against the poverty and drudgery and monotony of his existence. _She_ went on dream sprees  [dream sprees - достиг кленовой авеню] in her Blue Castle. [blue castle - претенциозное сооружение, приправленное]  Roaring Abel, having no imagination, could not do that. _His_ escapes from reality had to be concrete. So she waved at him today with a sudden fellow feeling, [sudden fellow feeling - ничего не сказал]  and Roaring Abel, not too drunk to be astonished, nearly fell  [nearly fell - веселые мечты] off his seat in his amazement.

By this time they had reached Maple Avenue  [reached maple avenue - бессмысленные эркеры] and Uncle Herbert’s house, a large, pretentious structure peppered  [pretentious structure peppered - всегда смотрел как] with meaningless bay windows  [meaningless bay windows - удовлетворенный человек] and excrescent porches. [excrescent porches - удержал вэлэнси назад]  A house that always looked like  [always looked like - выросшие крыльца] a stupid, prosperous, self-satisfied man  [satisfied man - дом как] with warts on his face.

“A house like  [house like - валэнси сказал] that,” said Valancy solemnly, “is a blasphemy.”

Mrs. Frederick was shaken to her soul. What had Valancy said? [valancy said - сделал один]  Was it profane? Or only just queer? Mrs. Frederick took  [frederick took - предотвратить катастрофу] off her hat in Aunt Alberta’s spare-room with trembling hands. [trembling hands - фредерик предпринял]  She made one  [made one - слабую попытку] more feeble attempt  [feeble attempt - фредерик войлок] to avert disaster. [avert disaster - глава х]  She held Valancy back  [held valancy back - дрожащими руками] on the landing as Cousin Stickles went downstairs.

“Won’t you try to remember you’re a lady?” she pleaded.

“Oh, if there were only any hope of being able to forget it!” said Valancy wearily.

Mrs. Frederick felt  [frederick felt - нашел вэлэнси ищет] that she had not deserved this from Providence.



 CHAPTER X [chapter x - тетя веллингтон нахмурилась] 

 “Bless this food to our use and consecrate our lives to Thy service,” said Uncle Herbert briskly.

Aunt Wellington  [aunt wellington - что-то не так] frowned. [aunt wellington frowned -  неземной тон]  She always considered Herbert’s graces entirely  [graces entirely - находят убежище] too short and “flippant.” A grace, to be a grace in Aunt Wellington’s eyes, had to be at least three minutes long and uttered in an unearthly tone, [unearthly tone - раскосые глаза]  between a groan and a chant. As a protest she kept her head bent  [head bent - глаза как] a perceptible time  [perceptible time - голова наклонена] after all the rest had been lifted. When she permitted herself to sit upright  [sit upright - странный блеск] she found Valancy looking  [found valancy looking - тетя веллингтон] at her. Ever afterwards Aunt Wellington averred that she had known from that moment that there was something wrong  [something wrong - сидеть прямо] with Valancy. In those queer, slanted eyes  [slanted eyes - ощутимое время] of hers—“we should always have known she was not entirely _right_ with eyes like  [eyes like - социальная функция] that”—there was an odd gleam  [odd gleam - грациозность полностью] of mockery and amusement—as if Valancy were laughing at _her_. Such a thing was unthinkable, of course. Aunt Wellington at once ceased to think it.

Valancy was enjoying herself. She had never enjoyed  [never enjoyed - детские игры] herself at a “family reunion” before. In social function, [social function - никогда не нравились]  as in childish games, [childish games - всегда учтено ]  she had only “filled in.” Her clan had always considered  [always considered - белое мясо] her very dull. She had no parlour tricks. [parlour tricks - семейные вечеринки]  And she had been in the habit of taking refuge  [taking refuge - уловки в салоне] from the boredom of family parties  [family parties - голубой замок] in her Blue Castle, [blue castle - дядя Герберт резал]  which resulted in an absent-mindedness that increased her reputation for dulness and vacuity.

“She has no social presence whatever,” Aunt Wellington had decreed once and for all. Nobody dreamed  [nobody dreamed - выглядела девушкой] that Valancy was dumb in their presence merely  [presence merely - никто не мечтал] because she was afraid of them. Now she was no longer afraid  [longer afraid - дополнительный кусок] of them. The shackles had been stricken off her soul. She was quite prepared  [quite prepared - случай предлагался] to talk if occasion offered. [occasion offered - никогда не смел]  Meanwhile she was giving herself such freedom of thought as she had never dared  [never dared - больше боялся] to take before. She let herself go with a wild, inner exultation, [inner exultation - никто больше не сказал]  as Uncle Herbert carved  [uncle herbert carved - удивленно подумал] the turkey. Uncle Herbert gave Valancy a second look  [second look - просто присутствие] that day. Being a man, he didn’t know what she had done to her hair, but he thought surprisedly  [thought surprisedly - вполне подготовлен] that Doss was not such a bad-looking girl, [looking girl - внутреннее ликование]  after all; and he put an extra piece  [extra piece - чей долг] of white meat  [white meat - второй взгляд] on her plate.

“What herb is most injurious to a young lady’s beauty?” propounded Uncle Benjamin by way of starting conversation—“loosening things up a bit,” as he would have said.

Valancy, whose duty  [whose duty - разумные люди] it was to say, “What?” did not say it. Nobody else said  [nobody else said - дядя бенджамин ] it, so Uncle Benjamin, [uncle benjamin - кажутся ровными]  after an expectant pause, [expectant pause - веселая улыбка]  had to answer, “Thyme,” and felt that his riddle had fallen flat. [fallen flat - унылое собрание]  He looked resentfully  [looked resentfully - осматриваются] at Valancy, who had never failed  [never failed - маленькие корчиться] him before, but Valancy did not seem even  [seem even - посмотрели обиженно] to be aware of him. She was gazing around  [gazing around - выжидательная пауза] the table, examining relentlessly every one in this depressing assembly  [depressing assembly - новые глаза] of sensible people  [sensible people - никогда не подводили] and watching their little squirms  [little squirms - повалились] with a detached, amused smile. [amused smile - всегда держал] 

So these were the people she had always held  [always held - уродливые родинки] in reverence and fear. She seemed to see them with new eyes. [new eyes - говорливая тетя милдред] 

Cousin Gladys, [cousin gladys - двоюродный брат Глэдис]  who was always praising  [always praising - всегда хвалить] her son, who had died young, [died young - умерла молодым]  and always fighting  [always fighting - всегда драться] with her living one. [living one - жить один]  She had neuritis—or what she called neuritis. [called neuritis - называется неврит]  It jumped about from one part  [one part - одна часть] of her body to another. It was a convenient thing. [convenient thing - удобная вещь]  If anybody wanted  [anybody wanted - все хотели] her to go somewhere  [go somewhere - идти куда-то] she didn’t want to go she had neuritis in her legs. And always if any mental effort  [mental effort - умственное усилие] was required she could have neuritis in her head. You can’t _think_ with neuritis in your head, my dear.

“What an old humbug  [old humbug - старый обман] you are!” thought Valancy impiously.

Aunt Isabel. [aunt isabel - скажет что-нибудь нескромное]  Valancy counted  [valancy counted -  ушел] her chins. Aunt Isabel was the critic of the clan. She had always gone  [always gone - рецепты солений] about squashing people flat. [squashing people flat - раздавить людей ]  More members of it than Valancy were afraid of her. She had, it was conceded, a biting tongue. [biting tongue - случится] 

“I wonder what would happen  [would happen - ничего другого] to your face if you ever smiled,” speculated Valancy, unblushingly.

Second Cousin Sarah Taylor, with her great, pale, expressionless eyes, [expressionless eyes - плохая маленькая душа]  who was noted for the variety of her pickle recipes  [pickle recipes - рекламная фотография] and for nothing else. [nothing else - младшая кузина Джорджиана]  So afraid of saying something indiscreet  [saying something indiscreet - безэмоциональные глаза] that she never said anything worth listening to. So proper that she blushed when she saw the advertisement picture  [advertisement picture - на самом деле наслаждается] of a corset and had put a dress on her Venus de Milo statuette which made it look “real tasty.”

Little Cousin Georgiana. [little cousin georgiana - может случиться]  Not such a bad little soul. [bad little soul - всегда ищу]  But dreary—very. Always looking  [always looking - чье любимое развлечение] as if she had just been starched and ironed. Always afraid  [always afraid - valancy всегда удивлялся] to let herself go. The only thing she really enjoyed  [really enjoyed - всегда боюсь] was a funeral. You knew where you were with a corpse. Nothing more could happen  [could happen - пишу противоречивые письма] to _it_. But while there was life there was fear.

Uncle James. [uncle james - серая сторона]  Handsome, black, with his sarcastic, trap-like mouth  [like mouth - нападение на модернизм] and iron-grey side- [grey side - дядя бенджамин] burns, whose favourite amusement  [whose favourite amusement - дядя джеймс] was to write controversial letters  [write controversial letters - валэнси помнил] to the _Christian Times_, attacking Modernism. [attacking modernism - огромные мешки]  Valancy always wondered  [valancy always wondered - чувствительная вещь] if he looked as solemn when he was asleep as he did when awake. No wonder his wife had died young. [died young - ничего не держал]  Valancy remembered  [valancy remembered - как рот] her. A pretty, sensitive thing. [sensitive thing - умерла молодой]  Uncle James had denied her everything she wanted and showered on her everything she didn’t want. He had killed her—quite legally. She had been smothered and starved.

Uncle Benjamin, [uncle benjamin - отвратительно высокий лоб]  wheezy, pussy-mouthed. With great pouches  [great pouches - дядя веллингтон] under eyes that held nothing  [held nothing - , – подумала вэланси] in reverence.

Uncle Wellington. [uncle wellington - бледное лицо]  Long, pallid face, [pallid face - тетя веллингтон]  thin, pale-yellow hair—“one of the fair Stirlings”—thin, stooping body, [stooping body - тетя милдред думал]  abominably high forehead  [abominably high forehead - уродливые морщины] with such ugly wrinkles, [ugly wrinkles - модное вышитое бисером платье]  and “eyes about as intelligent as a fish’s,” thought Valancy. [,” thought valancy - сутулое тело ]  “Looks like a cartoon of himself.”

Aunt Wellington. [aunt wellington - великолепно устроенная]  Named Mary  [named mary - валанси пусть] but called by her husband’s name to distinguish her from Great-aunt Mary. [aunt mary - постоянная дама]  A massive, dignified, permanent lady. [permanent lady - колючие седые волосы]  Splendidly arranged, [splendidly arranged - седые волосы]  iron-grey hair. [grey hair - дядя герберт]  Rich, fashionable beaded dress. [fashionable beaded dress - тетя мэри]  Had _her_ moles removed by electrolysis—which Aunt Mildred thought  [aunt mildred thought - злая увертка] was a wicked evasion  [wicked evasion - по имени мэри] of the purposes of God.

Uncle Herbert, [uncle herbert - выразительный фраза]  with his spiky grey hair. [spiky grey hair - соответствует]  Aunt Alberta, [aunt alberta - как оливковое]  who twisted her mouth so unpleasantly in talking and had a great reputation  [great reputation - тетя альберта] for unselfishness because she was always giving  [always giving - мог вспомнить] up a lot of things she didn’t want. Valancy let  [valancy let - отличная репутация] them off easily in her judgment because she liked them, even if they were in Milton’s expressive phrase, [expressive phrase - всегда даю]  “stupidly good.” But she wondered for what inscrutable reason Aunt Alberta had seen fit  [seen fit - пухлые руки] to tie a black velvet ribbon around each of her chubby arms  [chubby arms - посмотрел через] above the elbow.

Then she looked across  [looked across - вернее обычные зубы] the table at Olive. Olive, who had been held up to her as a paragon of beauty, behaviour and success as long as she could remember. [could remember - валентность согласна]  “Why can’t you hold yourself like Olive, [like olive - эльфийские глаза потеряны]  Doss? Why can’t you stand correctly like Olive, Doss? Why can’t you speak prettily like Olive, Doss? Why can’t you make an effort, Doss?”

Valancy’s elfin eyes lost  [elfin eyes lost - рот может] their mocking glitter  [mocking glitter - пренебрежение оливковым] and became pensive  [became pensive - сверкающая бандо в руках] and sorrowful. You could not ignore or disdain Olive. [disdain olive - густые шелковые ресницы]  It was quite impossible  [quite impossible - может показать] to deny that she was beautiful and effective and sometimes she was a little intelligent. [little intelligent - белое бриллиантовое пламя]  Her mouth might  [mouth might - немного умный] be a trifle heavy—she might show  [might show - стал задумчивый] her fine, white, regular teeth rather  [regular teeth rather - совершенно невозможно] too lavishly when she smiled. But when all was said and done, Olive justified Uncle Benjamin’s summing up—“a stunning girl.” Yes, Valancy agreed  [valancy agreed - насмешливый блеск] in her heart, Olive was stunning.

Rich, golden-brown hair, [brown hair - ямочки всегда появляются]  elaborately dressed, [elaborately dressed - коричневый волосы]  with a sparkling bandeau holding  [sparkling bandeau holding - восковой палец] its glossy puffs  [glossy puffs - коричневый шелк] in place; large, brilliant blue eyes  [brilliant blue eyes - тощие руки] and thick silken lashes; [thick silken lashes - блестящие голубые глаза]  face of rose and bare neck  [bare neck - повторяющийся спазм] of snow, rising above her gown; great pearl bubbles  [great pearl bubbles - теневое кружево] in her ears; the blue-white diamond flame  [white diamond flame - большие жемчужные пузыри] on her long, smooth, waxen finger  [waxen finger - острый ноготь] with its rosy, pointed nail. [pointed nail - искусно одетый]  Arms of marble, gleaming through green chiffon  [green chiffon - прилично завернутый] and shadow lace. [shadow lace - зеленый шифон]  Valancy felt suddenly thankful that her own scrawny arms  [scrawny arms - блестящие пуфы] were decently swathed  [decently swathed - голая шея] in brown silk. [brown silk - даже одна ямочка]  Then she resumed her tabulation of Olive’s charms.

Tall. Queenly. Confident. Everything that Valancy was _not_. Dimples, too, in cheeks and chin. “A woman with dimples always gets  [dimples always gets - третье предприятие встретилось] her own way,” thought Valancy, in a recurring spasm  [recurring spasm - бледно-зеленый жоржет] of bitterness at the fate which had denied her even one dimple. [even one dimple - дядя Веллингтон не одобряет] 

Olive was only a year younger  [year younger - фамильная реликвия] than Valancy, though a stranger would  [stranger would - беспокойное дело] have thought that there was at least ten years  [least ten years - годом моложе] between them. But nobody ever dreaded old maidenhood for her. Olive had been surrounded by a crowd of eager beaus since  [eager beaus since - три года] her early teens, [early teens - сесил прайс]  just as her mirror was always surrounded  [always surrounded - валэнси может] by a fringe of cards, photographs, programmes and invitations. At eighteen, when she had graduated from Havergal College, [havergal college - дональд джексон]  Olive had been engaged to Will Desmond, lawyer in embryo. Will Desmond had died and Olive had mourned for him properly for two years. [two years - незнакомец буду]  When she was twenty-three she had a hectic affair  [hectic affair - ранний подростковый возраст] with Donald Jackson. [donald jackson - брюссельское кружево]  But Aunt and Uncle Wellington disapproved  [uncle wellington disapproved - шелк цвета слоновой кости задрапирован] of that and in the end Olive dutifully gave him up. Nobody in the Stirling clan—whatever outsiders might say—hinted that she did so because Donald himself was cooling off. However that might be, Olive’s third venture met  [third venture met - нетерпеливый кавалер с тех пор] with everybody’s approval. Cecil Price  [cecil price - уже доверенный] was clever and handsome and “one of the Port Lawrence Prices.” Olive had been engaged to him for three years. [three years - сундук надежды]  He had just graduated in civil engineering  [civil engineering - всегда окруженный] and they were to be married as soon as he landed a contract. Olive’s hope chest  [hope chest - колледж Хавергал] was full to overflowing with exquisite things  [exquisite things - гражданское строительство] and Olive had already confided  [already confided - школа использовала] to Valancy what her wedding-dress was to be. Ivory silk draped  [ivory silk draped - два года] with lace, white satin court train, lined with pale green georgette, [pale green georgette - минимум десять лет]  heirloom veil  [heirloom veil - изысканные вещи] of Brussels lace. [brussels lace - трое счастливчиков]  Valancy knew also—though Olive had not told her—that the bridesmaids were selected and that she was not among them.

“I don’t know what the poor idiots see  [poor idiots see - бедные идиоты видят] in me, that drives them to make such double idiots  [double idiots - двойные идиоты] of themselves,” Olive  [,” olive - », оливка] was wont to say. Valancy would  [valancy would - валэнси] have liked to say, “I don’t either,” but truth and diplomacy both restrained her. She _did_ know, perfectly well. [perfectly well - прекрасно]  Olive Stirling  [olive stirling - олив стирлинг] was one of the girls about whom men do go mad  [go mad - сойти с ума] just as indubitably as she, Valancy, was one of the girls at whom no man ever looked twice.

“And yet,” thought Valancy, summing her up with a new and merciless conclusiveness, [merciless conclusiveness - беспощадная убедительность]  “she’s like a dewless morning. [dewless morning - безросистое утро]  There’s _something_ lacking.”



 CHAPTER XI [chapter xi - глава xi] 

 Meanwhile the dinner in its earlier stages  [earlier stages - ранее] was dragging its slow length along true to Stirling form. [stirling form - форма стирлинга]  The room was chilly, in spite of the calendar, and Aunt Alberta  [aunt alberta - тетя альберта] had the gas-logs lighted. [logs lighted - зажженные бревна]  Everybody in the clan envied  [clan envied - клан завидовал] her those gas-logs except Valancy. [logs except valancy - бревна, кроме valancy]  Glorious open fires blazed in every room  [every room - каждая комната] of her Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] when autumnal nights  [autumnal nights - осенние ночи] were cool, but she would have frozen to death in it before she would have committed the sacrilege of a gas-log. Uncle Herbert made  [uncle herbert made - дядя герберт сделал] his hardy perennial joke  [hardy perennial joke - жесткую многолетнюю шутку] when he helped Aunt Wellington  [helped aunt wellington - помогал тете веллингтон] to the cold meat—“Mary, will you have a little lamb?” Aunt Mildred told the same old story  [old story - старая история] of once finding a lost ring  [lost ring - потерянное кольцо] in a turkey’s crop. Uncle Benjamin told _his_ favourite prosy tale of how he had once chased and punished a now famous man  [famous man - знаменитый человек] for stealing apples. [stealing apples - кража яблок]  Second Cousin Jane described all her sufferings with an ulcerating tooth. [ulcerating tooth - язвенный зуб]  Aunt Wellington admired  [aunt wellington admired - тетя веллингтон восхищалась] the pattern of Aunt Alberta’s silver teaspoons  [silver teaspoons - серебряные чайные ложки] and lamented the fact that one of her own had been lost.

“It spoiled the set. I could never get  [could never get - никогда не мог получить] it matched. And it was my wedding-present from dear old Aunt Matilda.”

Aunt Isabel thought  [aunt isabel thought - тетя изабель мысль] the seasons were changing and couldn’t imagine what had become of our good, old-fashioned springs. [fashioned springs - модные пружины]  Cousin Georgiana, [cousin georgiana - кузен Джорджиана]  as usual, discussed the last funeral  [last funeral - последние похороны] and wondered, audibly, “which of us will be the next to pass away.” Cousin Georgiana could never say anything as blunt as “die.” Valancy thought she could tell  [could tell - могу сказать] her, but didn’t. Cousin Gladys, [cousin gladys - кузен Глэдис]  likewise as usual, had a grievance. Her visiting nephews  [visiting nephews - в гостях у племянников] had nipped all the buds off her house-plants and chivied her brood of fancy chickens—“squeezed some of them actually to death, my dear.”

“Boys will be boys,” reminded Uncle Herbert tolerantly.

“But they needn’t be ramping, rampageous animals,” retorted Cousin Gladys, looking round  [looking round - оглянувшись] the table for appreciation of her wit. Everybody smiled except Valancy. Cousin Gladys remembered  [cousin gladys remembered - двоюродный брат Глэдис вспомнил] that. A few minutes later, [minutes later - минуты позже]  when Ellen Hamilton  [ellen hamilton - Эллен Гамильтон] was being discussed, Cousin Gladys spoke  [cousin gladys spoke - кузен Глэдис говорил] of her as “one of those shy, plain girls  [plain girls - простые девушки] who can’t get husbands,” and glanced significantly  [glanced significantly - многозначительно взглянула] at Valancy.

Uncle James thought  [uncle james thought - дядя Джеймс подумал] the conversation was sagging to a rather low plane  [rather low plane - довольно низкий самолет ] of personal gossip. [personal gossip - личные сплетни]  He tried to elevate it by starting an abstract discussion  [abstract discussion - абстрактное обсуждение] on “the greatest happiness.” Everybody was asked to state his or her idea of “the greatest happiness.”

Aunt Mildred thought  [aunt mildred thought - тетя милдред подумала] the greatest happiness— [greatest happiness - величайшее счастье] for a woman—was to be “a loving and beloved wife  [beloved wife - любимая жена] and mother.” Aunt Wellington thought it would be to travel in Europe. Olive thought  [olive thought - оливковая мысль] it would be to be a great singer like Tetrazzini. Cousin Gladys remarked mournfully that _her_ greatest happiness would  [greatest happiness would - величайшее счастье было бы] be to be free—absolutely free—from neuritis. Cousin Georgiana’s greatest happiness would be “to have her dear, dead brother Richard back.” Aunt Alberta remarked vaguely that the greatest happiness was to be found in “the poetry of life” and hastily gave  [hastily gave - поспешно дал] some directions to her maid to prevent any one asking  [one asking - один спрашивал] her what she meant. Mrs. Frederick said  [frederick said - фредерик сказал] the greatest happiness was to spend your life in loving service  [loving service - любящая услуга] for others, and Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат Стиклс] and Aunt Isabel agreed  [aunt isabel agreed - тетя Изабель согласилась] with her—Aunt Isabel with a resentful air, [resentful air - обиженный вид]  as if she thought Mrs. [thought mrs - мысль миссис]  Frederick had taken the wind out of her sails by saying it first. “We are all too prone,” continued Mrs. Frederick, determined not to lose so good an opportunity, “to live in selfishness, worldliness and sin.” The other women all felt rebuked  [felt rebuked - почувствовал упрек] for their low ideals, [low ideals - низкие идеалы]  and Uncle James  [uncle james - дядя джеймс] had a conviction that the conversation had been uplifted with a vengeance.

“The greatest happiness,” said Valancy suddenly and distinctly, “is to sneeze when you want to.”

Everybody stared. [everybody stared - все смотрели]  Nobody felt  [nobody felt - никто не почувствовал] it safe to say anything. [say anything - ничего не сказать]  Was Valancy trying  [valancy trying - попробовать Валанси] to be funny? It was incredible. Mrs. Frederick, who had been breathing easier since  [breathing easier since - дышится легче с тех пор] the dinner had progressed so far without  [far without - далеко без] any outbreak on the part of Valancy, began to tremble again. But she deemed it the part of prudence to say nothing. [say nothing - ничего не сказать]  Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] was not so prudent. He rashly rushed  [rashly rushed - опрометчиво бросился] in where Mrs. Frederick feared  [frederick feared - фредерик боялся] to tread.

“Doss,” he chuckled, “what is the difference between a young girl  [young girl - молодая девушка] and an old maid?”

“One is happy and careless and the other is cappy and hairless,” said Valancy. “You have asked that riddle at least fifty times  [least fifty times - по меньшей мере пятьдесят раз] in my recollection, Uncle Ben. [uncle ben - дядя бен]  Why don’t you hunt up some new riddles  [new riddles - новый загадки] if riddle you _must_? It is such a fatal mistake  [fatal mistake - фатальная ошибка] to try to be funny if you don’t succeed.”

Uncle Benjamin stared foolishly. Never in his life had he, Benjamin Stirling, [benjamin stirling - бенджамин стирлинг]  of Stirling and Frost, been spoken to so. And by Valancy of all people! He looked feebly around  [looked feebly around - слабо огляделся] the table to see what the others thought  [others thought - другие думали] of it. Everybody was looking rather blank. [looking rather blank - выглядел довольно пустым]  Poor Mrs. [poor mrs - бедная миссис]  Frederick had shut her eyes. And her lips moved tremblingly—as if she were praying. Perhaps she was. The situation was so unprecedented that nobody knew  [nobody knew - никто не знал] how to meet it. Valancy went  [valancy went - валэнси ушел] on calmly eating  [calmly eating - спокойно ест] her salad as if nothing out of the usual had occurred.

Aunt Alberta, [aunt alberta - тетя альберта]  to save her dinner, plunged into an account of how a dog had bitten her recently. Uncle James, [uncle james - дядя джеймс]  to back her up, asked where the dog had bitten her.

“Just a little below the Catholic church,” said Aunt Alberta.

At that point Valancy laughed. [point valancy laughed - пойнт вэлэнси смеялась]  Nobody else laughed. [nobody else laughed - никто больше не смеялся]  What was there to laugh at?

“Is that a vital part?” asked Valancy.

“What do you mean?” said bewildered Aunt Alberta, and Mrs. Frederick was almost driven  [almost driven - почти загнали ] to believe that she had served God  [served god - служил богу] all her years for naught.

Aunt Isabel concluded  [aunt isabel concluded - тетя Изабель заключила] that it was up to her to suppress Valancy. [suppress valancy - подавить валэнси] 

“Doss, you are horribly thin,” she said. “You are _all_ corners. Do you _ever_ try to fatten up a little?”

“No.” Valancy  [.” valancy - ». valancy ] was not asking quarter  [asking quarter - просить милостыню] or giving it. “But I can tell you where you’ll find a beauty parlor  [beauty parlor - салон красоты] in Port Lawrence  [port lawrence - порт лоуренс] where they can reduce the number of your chins.”

“_Val-an-cy_!” The protest was wrung from Mrs. Frederick. She meant her tone to be stately and majestic, as usual, but it sounded more like an imploring whine. [imploring whine -  умоляющее нытье ]  And she did not say “Doss.”

“She’s feverish,” said Cousin Stickles to Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin -  дядя Бенджамин ] in an agonised whisper. [agonised whisper -  мучительный шепот двоюродный брат палочки]  “We’ve thought she’s seemed feverish  [seemed feverish -  казался лихорадочным ] for several days.”

“She’s gone dippy, [gone dippy - сильно взволнован]  in my opinion,” growled Uncle Benjamin. “If not, she ought to be spanked. Yes, spanked.”

“You can’t spank her.” Cousin Stickles  [.” cousin stickles - чьи уши] was much agitated. [much agitated - может сказать]  “She’s twenty-nine years old.”

“So there is that advantage, at least, in being twenty-nine,” said Valancy, whose ears  [whose ears - весь клан стирлингов] had caught this aside.

“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, “when I am dead you may say  [may say - может быть корова валентность] what you please. As long as I am alive I demand to be treated with respect.”

“Oh, but you know we’re all dead,” said Valancy, “the whole Stirling clan. [whole stirling clan - подавленный смех]  Some of us are buried and some aren’t—yet. That is the only difference.” “Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, thinking it might cow Valancy, [might cow valancy - никогда ничего не видел]  “do you remember the time you stole the raspberry jam?”

Valancy flushed scarlet—with suppressed laughter, [suppressed laughter - хорошее варенье]  not shame. She had been sure Uncle Benjamin would drag that jam in somehow.

“Of course I do,” she said. “It was good jam. [good jam - кажется желудок]  I’ve always been sorry I hadn’t time to eat more of it before you found me. Oh, _look_ at Aunt Isabel’s profile on the wall. Did you ever see anything  [ever see anything - включая тетю изабель] so funny?”

Everybody looked, [everybody looked - худшая вещь валэнси]  including Aunt Isabel  [including aunt isabel - все смотрели] herself, which of course, destroyed it. But Uncle Herbert said kindly, “I—I wouldn’t eat any more if I were you, Doss. It isn’t that I grudge it—but don’t you think it would be better for yourself? Your—your stomach seems  [stomach seems - держитесь правее] a little out of order.”

“Don’t worry about my stomach, old dear,” said Valancy. “It is all right. I’m going to keep right  [keep right - стирлинги думали валэнси ] on eating. It’s so seldom I get the chance of a satisfying meal.”

It was the first time  [first time - каждую функцию стирлинга] any one had been called “old dear” in Deerwood. The Stirlings thought Valancy  [stirlings thought valancy - приятная еда] had invented the phrase and they were afraid of her from that moment. There was something so uncanny about such an expression. But in poor Mrs. [poor mrs - первый раз]  Frederick’s opinion the reference to a satisfying meal  [satisfying meal - бедная миссис] was the worst thing Valancy  [worst thing valancy - оставить валентность] had said yet. [said yet - уйти]  Valancy had always been a disappointment to her. Now she was a disgrace. She thought she would have to get up and go away  [go away - упомянуть Барни Снайта] from the table. Yet she dared not leave Valancy  [leave valancy - сказал еще] there.

Of course they abused him. Nobody ever  [nobody ever - никто никогда] had a good word  [good word - доброе слово] to say of Barney Snaith. [barney snaith - барни снайт]  All the old, wild tales  [wild tales - дикие сказки] were canvassed—the defaulting cashier- [defaulting cashier - неплательщик кассира] counterfeiter-infidel-murderer-in-hiding legends  [hiding legends - скрывать легенды] were thrashed out. Uncle Wellington  [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон] was very indignant that such a creature should be allowed to exist at all in the neighbourhood of Deerwood. He didn’t know what the police at Port Lawrence  [port lawrence - порт лоуренс] were thinking of. Everybody would  [everybody would - все бы] be murdered in their beds some night. It was a shame that he should be allowed to be at large after all that he had done.

“What _has_ he done?” asked Valancy suddenly.

Uncle Wellington stared  [uncle wellington stared - дядя веллингтон пялился] at her, forgetting that she was to be ignored.

“Done! Done! He’s done _everything_.”

“_What_ has he done?” repeated Valancy inexorably. “What do you _know_ that he has done? You’re always running  [always running - всегда бежит] him down. And what has ever been proved against him?”

“I don’t argue with women,” said Uncle Wellington. “And I don’t need proof. [need proof - нужны доказательства]  When a man hides  [man hides - человек прячется] himself up there on an island in Muskoka, year in and year out, and nobody can find out where he came from or how he lives, or what he does there, _that’s_ proof enough. Find a mystery and you find a crime.”

“The very idea of a man named Snaith!” said Second Cousin Sarah. “Why, the name itself is enough to condemn him!”

“I wouldn’t like to meet him in a dark lane,” shivered Cousin Georgiana.

“What do you suppose he would do to you?” asked Valancy.

“Murder me,” said Cousin Georgiana solemnly.

“Just for the fun of it?” suggested Valancy.

“Exactly,” said Cousin Georgiana unsuspiciously. “When there is so much smoke  [much smoke - много дыма] there must be some fire. I was afraid he was a criminal when he came here first. I _felt_ he had something to hide. I am not often mistaken  [often mistaken - часто ошибается] in my intuitions.”

“Criminal! Of course he’s a criminal,” said Uncle Wellington. “Nobody doubts it”—glaring at Valancy. “Why, they say he served a term in the penitentiary for embezzlement. I don’t doubt it. And they say he’s in with that gang that are perpetrating all those bank robberies round  [bank robberies round - грабежи банков вокруг] the country.”

“_Who_ say?” asked Valancy.

Uncle Wellington knotted  [uncle wellington knotted -  дядя Веллингтон завязанный] his ugly forehead  [ugly forehead - уродливый лоб] at her. What had got into this confounded girl, [confounded girl - озадаченная девушка]  anyway? He ignored the question.

“He has the identical look  [identical look - идентичный взгляд] of a jail-bird,” snapped Uncle Benjamin. “I noticed it the first time  [first time - первый раз] I saw him.”

“‘A fellow by the hand of nature marked, [nature marked - природа отмечена]  Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame’,”

 declaimed Uncle James. [declaimed uncle james - декламировал дядя джеймс]  He looked enormously pleased  [looked enormously pleased - выглядел чрезвычайно довольным] over managing to work that quotation in at last. He had been waiting all his life for the chance.

“One of his eyebrows is an arch and the other is a triangle,” said Valancy. “Is _that_ why you think him so villainous?”

Uncle James lifted  [uncle james lifted - дядя джеймс поднял] _his_ eyebrows. Generally when Uncle James lifted his eyebrows the world came  [world came - мир пришел] to an end. This time it continued to function.

“How do _you_ know his eyebrows so well, Doss?” asked Olive, a trifle maliciously. [trifle maliciously - мелочь злонамеренно]  Such a remark would  [remark would - замечание бы] have covered Valancy  [covered valancy - покрытая валентность] with confusion two weeks ago, and Olive knew  [olive knew - олив знала] it.

“Yes, how?” demanded Aunt Wellington.

“I’ve seen him twice and I looked at him closely,” said Valancy composedly. “I thought his face the most interesting one  [interesting one - интересно] I ever saw.”

“There is no doubt there is something fishy  [something fishy - что-то подозрительное] in the creature’s past life,” said Olive, who began to think she was decidedly out of the conversation, which had centred so amazingly around Valancy. [amazingly around valancy - удивительно вокруг вэлэнси]  “But he can hardly be guilty of _everything_ he’s accused of, you know.”

Valancy felt annoyed  [valancy felt annoyed - валэнси почувствовала раздражение] with Olive. Why should _she_ speak up in even this qualified defence  [qualified defence - квалифицированная защита] of Barney Snaith? [barney snaith - барни снайт]  What had _she_ to do with him? For that matter, what had Valancy? But Valancy did not ask herself this question.

“They say he keeps dozens  [keeps dozens - держит десятки] of cats in that hut up back on Mistawis,” said Second Cousin Sarah Taylor, by way of appearing not entirely ignorant  [entirely ignorant - совершенно невежественны] of him.

Cats. It sounded quite alluring  [sounded quite alluring - звучало довольно заманчиво] to Valancy, in the plural. She pictured an island in Muskoka haunted  [muskoka haunted - мускока преследовала] by pussies.

“That alone shows  [alone shows - один показывает] there is something wrong  [something wrong - что-то не так] with him,” decreed Aunt Isabel.

“People who don’t like cats,” said Valancy, attacking her dessert with a relish, “always seem to think that there is some peculiar virtue  [peculiar virtue - особая добродетель] in not liking them.”

“The man hasn’t a friend except Roaring Abel, [roaring abel - ревущий абель] ” said Uncle Wellington. “And if Roaring Abel had kept away  [kept away - держится подальше] from him, as everybody else  [everybody else - все остальные] did, it would have been better for—for some members of his family.”

Uncle Wellington’s rather lame conclusion  [rather lame conclusion - довольно неубедительный вывод ] was due to a marital glance  [marital glance - свадебный взгляд] from Aunt Wellington reminding  [aunt wellington reminding - напоминает тетя Веллингтон] him of what he had almost forgotten—that there were girls at the table.

“If you mean,” said Valancy passionately, “that Barney Snaith  [barney snaith - барни снайт] is the father of Cecily Gay’s child, he _isn’t_. It’s a wicked lie.”

In spite of her indignation Valancy  [indignation valancy - возмущение валентности] was hugely amused  [hugely amused - весьма удивленно] at the expression of the faces around  [faces around - лица вокруг] that festal table. [festal table - праздничный стол]  She had not seen anything like  [seen anything like - видела что-то вроде] it since the day, seventeen years ago, [seventeen years ago - семнадцать лет назад]  when at Cousin Gladys’ thimble party, they discovered that she had got—SOMETHING—in her head at school. _Lice_ in her head! Valancy was done with euphemisms.

Poor Mrs. [poor mrs - бедная миссис]  Frederick was almost in a state of collapse. She had believed—or pretended to believe—that Valancy still supposed  [valancy still supposed - валэнси все еще предполагается] that children were found in parsley beds. [parsley beds - кровати с петрушкой] 

“Hush—hush!” implored Cousin Stickles.

“I don’t mean to hush,” said Valancy perversely. “I’ve hush—hushed all my life. I’ll scream if I want to. Don’t make me want to. And stop talking nonsense  [stop talking nonsense - прекратите нести чушь] about Barney Snaith.”

Valancy didn’t exactly understand  [exactly understand - точно понять] her own indignation. What did Barney Snaith’s imputed crimes  [imputed crimes - вменяемые преступления] and misdemeanours matter  [misdemeanours matter - проступки имеют значение] to her? And why, out of them all, did it seem most intolerable that he should have been poor, pitiful little Cecily Gay’s false lover? [false lover - ложная любовница]  For it _did_ seem intolerable to her. She did not mind when they called him a thief and a counterfeiter and jail-bird; but she could not endure to think that he had loved and ruined Cecily Gay. [ruined cecily gay - погубила сесили гей]  She recalled his face on the two occasions  [two occasions - два случая] of their chance meetings—his twisted, enigmatic, engaging smile, [engaging smile - обаятельная улыбка]  his twinkle, his thin, sensitive, almost ascetic lips, [almost ascetic lips - почти аскетические губы]  his general air  [general air - общий воздух] of frank daredeviltry. [frank daredeviltry - откровенная сорвиголова]  A man with such a smile and lips might  [lips might - губы могли] have murdered or stolen but he could not have betrayed. She suddenly hated every one who said it or believed it of him.

“When _I_ was a young girl  [young girl - молодая девушка] I never thought  [never thought - никогда не думал] or spoke about such matters, Doss,” said Aunt Wellington, crushingly.

“But I’m not a young girl,” retorted Valancy, uncrushed. “Aren’t you always rubbing  [always rubbing - всегда трется] that into me? And you are all evil-minded, senseless gossips. [senseless gossips - бессмысленные сплетни]  Can’t you leave poor Cissy Gay alone? She’s dying. Whatever she did, God or the Devil has punished her enough for it. _You_ needn’t take a hand, too. As for Barney Snaith, [barney snaith - барни снайт]  the only crime he has been guilty of is living to himself and minding his own business. He can, it seems, get along without  [get along without - обойтись без] you. Which _is_ an unpardonable sin, [unpardonable sin - непростительный грех]  of course, in your little snobocracy.” Valancy coined that concluding word suddenly  [concluding word suddenly - заключительное слово внезапно] and felt that it was an inspiration. That was exactly what they were and not one of them was fit to mend another. [mend another -  починить другого] 

“Valancy, your poor father would turn over in his grave if he could hear  [could hear - могла слышать] you,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs - », сказала миссис]  Frederick.

“I dare say  [dare say - осмелилась бы сказать] he would like  [would like - хотела] that for a change,” said Valancy brazenly.

“Doss,” said Uncle James heavily, “the Ten Commandments  [ten commandments - десять заповедей] are fairly up to date still—especially the fifth. Have you forgotten that?”

“No,” said Valancy, [,” said valancy -  улучшить]  “but I thought _you_ had—especially the ninth. Have you ever thought, [ever thought - тетя альберта]  Uncle James, [uncle james - достаточно соли]  how dull life would  [dull life would - скучная жизнь] be without the Ten Commandments? [ten commandments - идти домой]  It is only when things are forbidden that they become fascinating.”

But her excitement had been too much for her. She knew, by certain unmistakable warnings, [certain unmistakable warnings - сразу сказал]  that one of her attacks of pain was coming on. It must not find her there. She rose from her chair.

“I am going home  [going home - сердито фыркнул] now. I only came for the dinner. It was very good, Aunt Alberta, [aunt alberta - благотворительность думает]  although your salad-dressing is not salt enough  [salt enough - толстый прав] and a dash of cayenne would improve  [cayenne would improve - дядя бенджамин наказан] it.”

None of the flabbergasted silver wedding guests could think of anything to say until the lawn gate clanged behind Valancy in the dusk. Then—

“She’s feverish—I’ve said right along  [said right along - молодая женщина разговаривает] she was feverish,” moaned Cousin Stickles.

Uncle Benjamin punished  [uncle benjamin punished - много меньше упоминаний] his pudgy left hand fiercely with his pudgy right. [pudgy right - обжигающая чашка] 

“She’s dippy—I tell you she’s gone dippy,” he snorted angrily. [snorted angrily - никогда не слышал]  “That’s all there is about it. Clean dippy.”

“Oh, Benjamin,” said Cousin Georgiana soothingly, “don’t condemn her too rashly. We _must_ remember what dear old Shakespeare says—that charity thinketh  [charity thinketh - щедрая доза] no evil.”

“Charity! Poppy-cock!” snorted Uncle Benjamin. “I never heard  [never heard - должен сказать] a young woman talk  [young woman talk - свинка может работать] such stuff in my life as she just did. Talking about things she ought to be ashamed to think of, much less mention. [much less mention - пусть амелия ставит]  Blaspheming! Insulting _us_! What she wants is a generous dose  [generous dose - приближаются простуды] of spank-weed and I’d like to be the one to administer it. H-uh-h-h-h!” Uncle Benjamin gulped down the half of a scalding cup  [scalding cup - две недели] of coffee.

“Do you suppose that the mumps could work  [mumps could work - немного похоже] on a person that way?” wailed Cousin Stickles.

“I opened an umbrella in the house yesterday,” sniffed Cousin Georgiana. “I _knew_ it betokened some misfortune.”

“Have you tried to find out if she has a temperature?” asked Cousin Mildred.

“She wouldn’t let Amelia put  [let amelia put - колючие седые волосы] the thermometer under her tongue,” whimpered Cousin Stickles.

Mrs. Frederick was openly in tears. All her defences were down.

“I must tell  [must tell - нервно дергать] you,” she sobbed, “that Valancy has been acting very strangely for over two weeks  [two weeks - начать с первого] now. She hasn’t been a bit like  [bit like - предложила консультацию] herself—Christine could tell you. I have hoped against hope that it was only one of her colds coming  [colds coming - мозговые штурмы в последнее время] on. But it is—it must be something worse.”

“This is bringing on my neuritis again,” said Cousin Gladys, putting her hand to her head.

“Don’t cry, Amelia,” said Herbert kindly, pulling nervously  [pulling nervously - дядя бенджамин] at his spiky grey hair. [spiky grey hair - сказал сегодня показал]  He hated “family ructions.” Very inconsiderate of Doss to start one  [start one - заметил что-то странное] at _his_ silver wedding. Who could have supposed she had it in her? “You’ll have to take her to a doctor. This may be only a—er—a brainstorm. There are such things as brainstorms nowadays, [brainstorms nowadays - неуравновешенный ум]  aren’t there?”

“I—I suggested consulting  [suggested consulting - ничего подобного] a doctor to her yesterday,” moaned Mrs. Frederick. “And she said she wouldn’t go to a doctor—wouldn’t. Oh, surely I have had trouble enough!”

“And she _won’t_ take Redfern’s Bitters,” said Cousin Stickles.

“Or _anything_,” said Mrs. Frederick.

“And she’s determined to go to the Presbyterian church,” said Cousin Stickles—repressing, however, to her credit be it said, the story of the bannister.

“That proves she’s dippy,” growled Uncle Benjamin. [uncle benjamin - никогда не слышала]  “I noticed something strange  [noticed something strange - бедная миссис] about her the minute she came in today. I noticed it _before_ today.” (Uncle Benjamin was thinking of “m-i-r-a-z-h.”) “Everything she said today showed  [said today showed - ничего похожего ] an unbalanced mind. [unbalanced mind - ничего подобного]  That question—‘Was it a vital part?’ Was there any sense at all in that remark? None whatever! [none whatever - родился прадедушкой]  There never was anything like  [anything like - касательно похоже] that in the Stirlings. It must be from the Wansbarras.”

Poor Mrs. [poor mrs - похоже]  Frederick was too crushed to be indignant.

“I never heard  [never heard - ужасная выставка] of anything like  [anything like - перестань чихать] that in the Wansbarras,” she sobbed.

“Your father was odd enough,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“Nobody wanted to marry her,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs - », сказала миссис]  Frederick, who felt that, somehow, Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] was blaming her.

“Well, fortunately there’s no outsider here,” snapped Uncle Benjamin. “We may keep  [may keep - может держать] it in the family yet. [family yet - семья еще]  I’ll take her over to see Dr. [see dr - посмотри, доктор]  Marsh tomorrow. [marsh tomorrow - завтра болото]  _I_ know how to deal with pig-headed people. [headed people - во главе людей]  Won’t that be best, James?”

“We must have medical advice certainly,” agreed Uncle James.

“Well, that’s settled. In the meantime, Amelia, act as if nothing had happened and keep an eye on her. Don’t let her be alone. Above all, don’t let her sleep alone.”

Renewed whimpers  [renewed whimpers - возобновление хныканья] from Mrs. Frederick.

“I can’t help it. Night before last I suggested she’d better have Christine sleep  [christine sleep - кристина спит] with her. She positively refused—_and locked her door_. Oh, you don’t know how she’s changed. She won’t work. At least, she won’t sew. She does her usual housework, [usual housework - обычная работа по дому]  of course. But she wouldn’t sweep the parlour yesterday morning, [parlour yesterday morning - гостиная вчера утром]  though we _always_ sweep it on Thursdays. She said she’d wait till  [wait till - подождите, пока] it was dirty. ‘Would you rather sweep  [rather sweep - скорее подмести] a dirty room  [dirty room - грязную комнату] than a clean one?’ I asked her. She said, ‘Of course. I’d see something  [see something - посмотрите кое-что] for my labour then.’ Think  [.’ think - ». думаю] of it!”

Uncle Benjamin thought  [uncle benjamin thought - думал дядя бенджамин] of it.

“The jar of potpourri”—Cousin Stickles pronounced it as spelled—“has disappeared from her room. I found the pieces in the next lot. [next lot - следующая]  She won’t tell us  [tell us - расскажи нам] what happened to it.”

“I should never have dreamed it of Doss,” said Uncle Herbert. “She has always seemed  [always seemed - всегда казалась] such a quiet, sensible girl. [sensible girl - разумная девушка]  A bit backward—but sensible.”

“The only thing you can be sure of in this world is the multiplication table,” said Uncle James, feeling cleverer  [feeling cleverer - чувствую себя умнее] than ever.

“Well, let’s cheer up,” suggested Uncle Benjamin. “Why are chorus girls like fine stock raisers?”

“Why?” asked Cousin Stickles, since it had to be asked and Valancy wasn’t there to ask it.

“Like to exhibit calves,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin.

Cousin Stickles thought Uncle Benjamin a little indelicate. [little indelicate - немного бесцеремонно]  Before Olive, too. But then, he was a man.

Uncle Herbert  [uncle herbert - дядя герберт] was thinking that things were rather dull  [rather dull - довольно скучно] now that Doss had gone.



 CHAPTER XII [chapter xii - глава xii] 

 Valancy hurried home  [valancy hurried home - валэнси поспешила домой] through the faint blue twilight—hurried too fast perhaps. [fast perhaps - быстро возможно]  The attack she had when she thankfully reached  [thankfully reached - к счастью, достигнуто] the shelter of her own room was the worst yet. [worst yet - худшее еще]  It was really very bad. She might die  [might die - может умереть] in one of those spells. It would be dreadful to die in such pain. Perhaps—perhaps this was death. Valancy felt pitifully alone. When she could think  [could think - мог бы думать ] at all she wondered what it would be like to have some one with her who could sympathise—some one who really cared—just to hold her hand tight, [hand tight - сжатие рук]  if nothing else—some one just to say, “Yes, I know. It’s dreadful—be brave—you’ll soon be better;” not some one merely fussy  [one merely fussy - одна просто суетливая] and alarmed. Not her mother or Cousin Stickles. [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат прилипает]  Why did the thought of Barney Snaith come  [barney snaith come - барни снайт пришел] into her mind? Why did she suddenly feel, [suddenly feel - внезапно почувствуешь]  in the midst of this hideous loneliness  [hideous loneliness - отвратительное одиночество] of pain, that _he_ would be sympathetic—sorry for any one that was suffering? Why did he seem to her like an old, well-known friend? [known friend - известный друг]  Was it because she had been defending him—standing up to her family for him?

She was so bad at first that she could not even get  [even get - даже получить] herself a dose of Dr. Trent’s prescription. But eventually she managed it, and soon after relief came. [relief came - наступило облегчение]  The pain left  [pain left - боль осталась] her and she lay on her bed, spent, exhausted, in a cold perspiration. [cold perspiration - холодный пот]  Oh, that had been horrible! She could not endure many  [endure many - вытерпеть много] more attacks like  [attacks like - приступы, подобные] that. One didn’t mind dying  [mind dying - ум умирает] if death could  [death could - смерть могла] be instant and painless. But to be hurt so in dying!

Suddenly she found herself laughing. That dinner _had_ been fun. And it had all been so simple. She had merely _said_ the things she had always _thought_. Their faces—oh, their faces! Uncle Benjamin—poor, flabbergasted Uncle Benjamin! [flabbergasted uncle benjamin - изумление дядя бенджамин]  Valancy felt quite sure he would make  [would make - сделал бы] a new will that very night. Olive would get Valancy’s share of his fat hoard. [fat hoard - жирный запас]  Olive had always got Valancy’s share of everything. Remember the dust-pile.

To laugh at her clan as she had always wanted  [always wanted - всегда хотел] to laugh was all the satisfaction she could get  [could get - не мог получить] out of life now. But she thought it was rather pitiful  [rather pitiful - довольно жалко] that it should be so. Might she not pity herself a little when nobody else  [nobody else - никто другой] did?

Valancy got  [valancy got - валенси получил] up and went to her window. The moist, beautiful wind blowing across groves of young-leafed wild trees touched her face with the caress of a wise, tender, old friend. [old friend - старый друг]  The lombardies in Mrs. Tredgold’s lawn, off to the left—Valancy could just see them between the stable and the old carriage- [old carriage - старая повозка ] shop—were in dark purple silhouette  [dark purple silhouette - темно-фиолетовый силуэт] against a clear sky  [clear sky - чистое небо] and there was a milk-white, pulsating star  [pulsating star - пульсирующая звезда] just over one of them, like a living pearl  [living pearl - живая жемчужина] on a silver-green lake. [green lake - зеленое озеро]  Far beyond  [far beyond - далеко за гранью] the station were the shadowy, purple-hooded woods around Lake Mistawis. A white, filmy mist hung  [filmy mist hung - повис пленочный туман] over them and just above it was a faint, young crescent. [young crescent - молодой полумесяц]  Valancy looked  [valancy looked - валенси выглядел] at it over her thin left shoulder. [thin left shoulder - тонкое левое плечо] 

“I wish,” she said whimsically, [said whimsically - причудливо сказал]  “that I may have _one_ little dust-pile before I die.”



 CHAPTER XIII [chapter xiii - глава xiii] 

 Uncle Benjamin found  [uncle benjamin found - дядя вениамин нашел] he had reckoned without  [reckoned without - рассчиталась без] his host when he promised so airily to take Valancy  [take valancy - взять валэнси] to a doctor. Valancy would  [valancy would - валенси бы] not go. Valancy laughed  [valancy laughed - валенси засмеялась] in his face.

“Why on earth should I go to Dr. Marsh? There’s nothing the matter with my mind. Though you all think I’ve suddenly gone crazy. [suddenly gone crazy - внезапно сошла с ума]  Well, I haven’t. I’ve simply grown tired  [simply grown tired - просто устала] of living to please other people and have decided to please myself. It will give you something to talk about besides my stealing the raspberry jam. [raspberry jam - малиновое варенье]  So that’s that.”

“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, solemnly and helplessly, “you are not—like yourself.”

“Who am I like, then?” asked Valancy.

Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя вениамин] was rather posed. [rather posed - скорее позировали] 

“Your Grandfather Wansbarra,” he answered desperately. [answered desperately - отвечали отчаянно] 

“Thanks.” Valancy looked pleased. “That’s a real compliment. [real compliment - настоящий комплимент]  I remember Grandfather Wansbarra. [remember grandfather wansbarra - помните дедушку Вансбарру]  He was one of the few human beings  [human beings - человеческие существа] I _have_ known—almost the only one. Now, it is of no use to scold or entreat or command, Uncle Benjamin—or exchange anguished glances  [exchange anguished glances - обменивались страдальческими взглядами] with Mother and Cousin Stickles. [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат палочки]  I am not going to any doctor. And if you bring any doctor here I won’t see him. So what are you going to do about it?”

What indeed! It was not seemly—or even possible—to hale Valancy doctorwards  [hale valancy doctorwards - хейл валэнси доктора] by physical force. [physical force - физическая сила]  And in no other way could  [way could - как мог] it be done, seemingly. Her mother’s tears and imploring entreaties availed  [imploring entreaties availed - умоляющие мольбы помогли] not.

“Don’t worry, Mother,” said Valancy, lightly but quite respectfully. [quite respectfully - вполне уважительно]  “It isn’t likely I’ll do anything very terrible. But I mean to have a little fun.”

“Fun!” Mrs. Frederick uttered  [frederick uttered - фредерик произнес] the word as if Valancy had said she was going to have a little tuberculosis. [little tuberculosis - немного туберкулеза] 

Olive, sent by her mother to see if _she_ had any influence over Valancy, came away  [came away - ушли] with flushed cheeks  [flushed cheeks - раскрасневшиеся щеки] and angry eyes. [angry eyes - сердитые глаза]  She told her mother that nothing could  [nothing could - ничего не мог] be done with Valancy. After _she_, Olive, had talked to her just like a sister, tenderly and wisely, all Valancy had said, narrowing her funny eyes  [funny eyes - смешные глаза] to mere slips, [mere slips - просто оговорки ]  was, “_I_ don’t show my gums when I laugh.”

“More as if she were talking to herself than to me. Indeed, Mother, all the time I was talking to her she gave me the impression of not really listening. [really listening - на самом деле слушаю]  And that wasn’t all. When I finally decided  [finally decided - наконец решил] that what I was saying had no influence over her I begged her, when Cecil came next week, not to say anything queer  [say anything queer - говорят что-нибудь странное] before him, at least. Mother, what do you think she said?”

“I’m sure I can’t imagine,” groaned Aunt Wellington, prepared for anything.

“She said, ‘I’d rather like  [rather like - скорее как] to shock Cecil. [shock cecil - шокировать сесил]  His mouth is too red for a man’s.’ Mother, [.’ mother - .' мать]  I can never feel  [never feel - никогда не чувствовать] the same to Valancy again.”

“Her mind is affected, Olive,” said Aunt Wellington solemnly. “You must not hold her responsible for what she says.”

When Aunt Wellington told Mrs. Frederick what Valancy had said to Olive, Mrs. Frederick wanted Valancy  [frederick wanted valancy - фредерик хотел валентность] to apologise.

“You made me apologise to Olive fifteen years ago for something I didn’t do,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , – сказал валентность]  “That old apology  [old apology - старое извинение] will do for now.”

Another solemn family conclave was held. They were all there except Cousin Gladys, [except cousin gladys - кроме кузины Глэдис]  who had been suffering such tortures of neuritis in her head “ever since poor Doss went queer” that she couldn’t undertake any responsibility. They decided—that is, they accepted a fact that was thrust in their faces—that the wisest thing  [wisest thing - самое мудрое решение] was to leave Valancy alone  [leave valancy alone - оставь вэланси в покое] for a while—“give her her head” as Uncle Benjamin expressed  [uncle benjamin expressed - дядя бенджамин выразился] it—“keep a careful eye  [careful eye - осторожный взгляд] on her but let her pretty much alone.” The term of “watchful waiting” had not been invented then, but that was practically the policy Valancy’s distracted relatives decided  [distracted relatives decided - рассеянные родственники решили] to follow.

“We must be guided by developments,” said Uncle Benjamin. “It is”—solemnly—“easier to scramble eggs  [scramble eggs - омлет] than unscramble them. Of course—if she becomes violent——”



 CHAPTER XIV [chapter xiv - глава xiv] 

 Life cannot stop  [life cannot stop - двоюродный брат дико цепляется] because tragedy enters  [tragedy enters - систематически] it. Meals must  [meals must - много луны] be made ready though  [made ready though - приготовлено, хотя и давно назначено] a son dies  [son dies - вторая неделя] and porches must  [porches must - никогда ничего] be repaired even  [repaired even - крыльца должны] if your only daughter is going out of her mind. Mrs. Frederick, in her systematic way, [systematic way - сын умирает]  had long ago appointed  [long ago appointed - жизнь не может остановиться] the second week  [second week - опасно провисает] in June for the repairing of the front porch, [front porch - первый этап]  the roof of which was sagging dangerously. [sagging dangerously - ревущий авель]  Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - отремонтированы даже] had been engaged to do it many moons  [many moons - понравился авель] before and Roaring Abel promptly appeared on the morning of the first day  [first day - даже валентность] of the second week, and fell to work. Of course he was drunk. Roaring Abel was never anything  [never anything - еда должна] but drunk. But he was only in the first stage, [first stage - первый день]  which made him talkative and genial. The odour of whisky on his breath nearly drove Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles wild  [cousin stickles wild - вступает трагедия] at dinner. Even Valancy, [even valancy - красноречивый разговор]  with all her emancipation, did not like it. But she liked Abel  [liked abel - парадное крыльцо] and she liked his vivid, eloquent talk, [eloquent talk - обеденная посуда]  and after she washed the dinner dishes  [dinner dishes - двоюродный брат прилипал мысль] she went out and sat on the steps and talked to him.

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles thought  [cousin stickles thought - распространится] it a terrible proceeding, [terrible proceeding - насмешливо улыбался]  but what could they do? Valancy only smiled mockingly  [smiled mockingly - говорить что-нибудь] at them when they called her in, and did not go. It was so easy to defy once you got started. [got started - первый шаг]  The first step  [first step - характерные комментарии] was the only one that really counted. [really counted - никогда не ремонтировался ]  They were both afraid to say anything  [say anything - окно комнаты] more to her lest she might make  [might make - июньское солнце] a scene before Roaring Abel, [roaring abel - действительно считал]  who would spread  [would spread - ужасное дело] it all over the country with his own characteristic comments  [characteristic comments - молот сработал] and exaggerations. It was too cold a day, in spite of the June sunshine, [june sunshine - начало]  for Mrs. Frederick to sit at the dining-room window  [room window - ревущий авель] and listen to what was said. She had to shut the window and Valancy and Roaring Abel had their talk to themselves. But if Mrs. Frederick had known what the outcome of that talk was to be she would have prevented it, if the porch was never repaired. [never repaired - может получиться] 

Valancy sat  [valancy sat - валенси понравилась] on the steps, defiant of the chill breeze  [chill breeze - заботится ли] of this cold June  [cold june -  холодный ветер] which had made Aunt Isabel aver the seasons were changing. She did not care whether  [care whether - неопрятный старый кузен] she caught a cold or not. It was delightful to sit there in that cold, beautiful, fragrant world  [fragrant world - не стесняйтесь] and feel free. [feel free - каждый удар]  She filled her lungs with the clean, lovely wind  [lovely wind - весело стучит] and held out her arms to it and let it tear her hair to pieces while she listened to Roaring Abel, [roaring abel - милый ветер]  who told her his troubles between intervals of hammering gaily  [hammering gaily - ароматный мир] in time to his Scotch songs. [scotch songs - ревущий авель]  Valancy liked  [valancy liked - песни шотландца] to hear him. Every stroke  [every stroke - холодный июнь] of his hammer fell true  [hammer fell true - валанси села] to the note.

Old Abel Gay, [old abel gay - поддерживал дела]  in spite of his seventy years, [seventy years - изрядно поскользнулся]  was handsome still, [handsome still - пятая глава]  in a stately, patriarchal manner. [patriarchal manner - нос должен]  His tremendous beard, [tremendous beard - семьдесят лет]  falling down over his blue flannel shirt, [blue flannel shirt - юношеский синий]  was still a flaming, untouched red, [untouched red - огромная борода]  though his shock of hair was white as snow, and his eyes were a fiery, youthful blue. [youthful blue - всегда держал]  His enormous, reddish-white eyebrows  [white eyebrows - нетронутый рыжий] were more like moustaches  [like moustaches - красивый еще] than eyebrows. Perhaps this was why he always kept  [always kept - белые брови] his upper lip scrupulously shaved. His cheeks were red and his nose ought  [nose ought - благороднейший римлянин] to have been, but wasn’t. It was a fine, upstanding, aquiline nose, [aquiline nose - вообще уснул]  such as the noblest Roman  [noblest roman - как усы] of them all might have rejoiced in. Abel was six feet two  [six feet two - старый абель гей] in his stockings, broad-shouldered, lean-hipped. In his youth he had been a famous lover, [famous lover - красочная панорама]  finding all women too charming to bind himself to one. His years had been a wild, colourful panorama  [colourful panorama - орлиный нос] of follies and adventures, gallantries, fortunes and misfortunes. He had been forty-five before he married—a pretty slip  [pretty slip - благочестиво пьян] of a girl whom his goings-on killed in a few years. Abel was piously drunk  [piously drunk -  патриархальная манера] at her funeral and insisted on repeating the fifty-fifth chapter  [fifth chapter - знаменитый любовник] of Isaiah—Abel knew most of the Bible and all the Psalms by heart—while the minister, whom he disliked, prayed or tried to pray. Thereafter his house was run by an untidy old cousin  [untidy old cousin - шесть футов два] who cooked his meals and kept things going  [kept things going - синяя фланелевая рубашка] after a fashion. In this unpromising environment little Cecilia Gay had grown up.

Valancy had known “Cissy Gay” fairly well in the democracy of the public school, [public school - пути разошлись ]  though Cissy  [though cissy - богословская стадия] had been three years younger  [three years younger - сентиментальный плаксивый] than she. After they left school  [left school - проснулся трезвым] their paths diverged  [paths diverged - покинул школу] and she had seen nothing  [seen nothing - государственная школа] of her. Old Abel  [old abel - последний] was a Presbyterian. That is, he got a Presbyterian preacher  [presbyterian preacher - сказал мистеру] to marry him, baptise his child and bury his wife; and he knew more about Presbyterian theology  [presbyterian theology - пресвитерианский проповедник] than most ministers, which made him a terror to them in arguments. But Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - старый авель] never went to church. Every Presbyterian minister  [every presbyterian minister - ревущий авель с тех пор] who had been in Deerwood had tried his hand—once—at reforming Roaring Abel. [reforming roaring abel - ревущий авель]  But he had not been pestered of late. Rev. Mr. Bently had been in Deerwood for eight years, [eight years - богохульный]  but he had not sought out Roaring Abel since  [roaring abel since - исправление ревущего авеля] the first three months  [first three months - три года моложе] of his pastorate. He had called on Roaring Abel then and found him in the theological stage  [theological stage - ничего не видел] of drunkenness—which always followed  [always followed - никогда ничего не сделал] the sentimental maudlin one, [sentimental maudlin one - красноречиво-молитвенный]  and preceded the roaring, blasphemous one. [blasphemous one - здравый пресвитерианский]  The eloquently prayerful one, [eloquently prayerful one - каждый пресвитерианский служитель ]  in which he realised himself temporarily and intensely as a sinner in the hands of an angry God, [angry god - всегда следовал]  was the final one. [final one - восемь лет]  Abel never went beyond it. He generally fell asleep  [generally fell asleep - первые три месяца] on his knees and awakened sober, [awakened sober - злой бог]  but he had never been “dead drunk” in his life. He told Mr. [told mr - хоть и сисси]  Bently that he was a sound Presbyterian  [sound presbyterian - пресвитерианское богословие] and sure of his election. He had no sins—that he knew of—to repent of.

“Have you never done anything  [never done anything - ревущий авель почесал] in your life that you are sorry for?” asked Mr. Bently.

Roaring Abel scratched  [roaring abel scratched - густую белую голову] his bushy white head  [bushy white head - сказал наконец] and pretended to reflect. “Well, yes,” he said finally. [said finally - пошел домой]  “There were some women I might have kissed and didn’t. I’ve always been sorry for _that_.”

Mr. Bently went  [bently went - регулярно посещал воскресную школу] out and went home. [went home - склонно ходил] 

Abel had seen that Cissy was properly baptised—jovially drunk at the same time himself. He made her go to church and Sunday School regularly. [sunday school regularly - причина вскоре просочилась]  The church people took  [church people took - ушли в никуда] her up and she was in turn a member of the Mission Band, [mission band - маленький работник]  the Girls’ Guild and the Young Women’s Missionary Society. [missionary society - миссионерская группа]  She was a faithful, unobtrusive, sincere, little worker. [little worker - отель раскрыт]  Everybody liked Cissy Gay and was sorry for her. She was so modest and sensitive and pretty in that delicate, elusive fashion  [elusive fashion - вернись] of beauty which fades so quickly if life is not kept in it by love and tenderness. But then liking and pity did not prevent them from tearing her in pieces like hungry cats when the catastrophe came. [catastrophe came - пол на кухне рассказал]  Four years previously Cissy Gay had gone up to a Muskoka hotel  [muskoka hotel - миссионерское общество] as a summer waitress. [summer waitress - сорри тайна]  And when she had come back  [come back - изменившееся существо] in the fall she was a changed creature. [changed creature - сесили удержали]  She hid herself away and went nowhere. [went nowhere - догадка выложена]  The reason soon leaked  [reason soon leaked - никто никогда не знал] out and scandal raged. [scandal raged - довольно обиженно]  That winter Cissy’s baby was born. Nobody ever knew  [nobody ever knew - прилежное расследование среди] who the father was. Cecily kept  [cecily kept - катастрофа пришел] her poor pale lips tightly locked on her sorry secret. [sorry secret - бушевал скандал]  Nobody dared ask Roaring Abel any questions about it. Rumour and surmise laid  [surmise laid - летняя официантка] the guilt at Barney Snaith’s door because diligent inquiry among  [diligent inquiry among -  церковные люди взяли] the other maids at the hotel revealed  [hotel revealed - неуловимая мода] the fact that nobody there had ever seen Cissy Gay “with a fellow.” She had “kept herself to herself” they said, rather resentfully. [rather resentfully - отель мускока]  “Too good for _our_ dances. And now look!”

Valancy hardly noticed  [valancy hardly noticed - валентность едва заметна] the profanity. Her attention was focussed on the horrible thought  [horrible thought - ужасная мысль] of poor, unhappy, disgraced little Cissy Gay, ill and helpless in that forlorn old house  [forlorn old house - заброшенный старый дом] out on the Mistawis road, [mistawis road - дорога к Миставису]  without a soul to help or comfort her. And this in a nominally Christian community  [nominally christian community - номинально христианская община] in the year of grace nineteen  [grace nineteen - благодать девятнадцать] and some odd!

“Do you mean to say that Cissy is all alone there now, with nobody to do anything for her—_nobody_?”

“Oh, she can move about a bit and get a bite and sup when she wants it. But she can’t work. It’s d——d hard for a man to work hard  [work hard - много работать] all day and go home  [go home - иди домой] at night tired  [night tired - ночь устала] and hungry and cook his own meals. Sometimes I’m sorry I kicked old Rachel Edwards out.” Abel described Rachel picturesquely.

“Her face looked  [face looked - лицо выглядело] as if it had wore out a hundred bodies. [hundred bodies -  сто тел]  And she moped. Talk about temper! Temper’s nothing to moping. She was too slow to catch worms, [catch worms - ловить червей]  and dirty—d——d dirty. I ain’t unreasonable—I know a man has to eat his peck before he dies—but she went over the limit. What d’ye sp’ose I saw that lady do? She’d made some punkin jam—had it on the table in glass jars  [glass jars - стеклянные банки] with the tops off. The dawg got  [dawg got - чувак получил] up on the table and stuck his paw into one of them. What did she do? She jest took holt  [jest took holt - шутка удалась] of the dawg and wrung the syrup off his paw back  [paw back - лапа назад] into the jar! Then screwed the top on and set it in the pantry. I sets open  [sets open - открывает] the door and says to her, ‘Go!’ The dame went, [dame went - дама пошла]  and I fired the jars of punkin after her, two at a time. Thought I’d die laughing  [die laughing - умереть от смеха] to see old Rachel run—with them punkin jars raining  [punkin jars raining - дождь из панкиновых банок] after her. She’s told everywhere  [told everywhere - везде рассказывали] I’m crazy, so nobody’ll come for love or money.”

“But Cissy _must_ have some one to look after her,” insisted Valancy, [,” insisted valancy - », настаивала Валенси]  whose mind  [whose mind - чей ум] was centred on this aspect of the case. She did not care whether Roaring Abel had any one to cook for him or not. But her heart was wrung for Cecilia Gay. [cecilia gay - сесилия веселая] 

“Oh, she gits on. Barney Snaith always drops in when he’s passing and does anything she wants done. [wants done - хочет сделать]  Brings her oranges and flowers and things. There’s a Christian for you. Yet that sanctimonious, snivelling parcel  [snivelling parcel - сопливая посылка] of St. Andrew’s people wouldn’t be seen on the same side of the road with him. Their dogs’ll go to heaven before they do. And their minister—slick as if the cat had licked him!”

“There are plenty of good people, [good people - хорошие люди]  both in St. Andrew’s and St. George’s, who would be kind to Cissy if you would behave  [would behave - будет вести себя] yourself,” said Valancy severely. “They’re afraid to go near  [go near - приходить рядом] your place.”

“Because I’m such a sad old dog? [sad old dog - грустная старая собака]  But I don’t bite—never bit any one in my life. A few loose words spilled around don’t hurt any one. And I’m not asking people  [asking people - спрашивая людей] to come. Don’t want ’em poking and prying about. What I want is a housekeeper. If I shaved every Sunday  [shaved every sunday - бриться каждое воскресенье] and went to church I’d get all the housekeepers I’d want. I’d be respectable then. But what’s the use of going to church when it’s all settled by predestination? Tell me that, Miss.”

“Is it?” said Valancy.

“Yes. Can’t git around  [git around - слоняться вокруг] it nohow. Wish I could. I don’t want either heaven  [want either heaven - хочу либо рай] or hell for steady. Wish a man could  [man could - человек может] have ’em mixed in equal proportions.”

“Isn’t that the way it is in this world?” said. Valancy thoughtfully—but rather as if her thought was concerned with something else  [something else - что-то еще] than theology.

“No, no,” boomed Abel, [,” boomed abel - , – прогремел авель]  striking a tremendous blow  [tremendous blow - огромный удар] on a stubborn nail. [stubborn nail - упорный гвоздь]  “There’s too much hell  [much hell - много ада] here—entirely too much hell. That’s why I get drunk  [get drunk - напиться] so often. It sets you free for a little while—free from yourself—yes, by God, free from predestination. Ever try  [ever try - никогда не пробовал] it?”

“No, I’ve another way  [another way - другой способ] of getting free,” said Valancy absently. “But about Cissy now. She _must_ have some one to look after her——”

“What are you harping on Sis for? Seems to me you ain’t bothered much  [bothered much - много беспокойства] about her up to now. You never even come  [never even come - никогда даже не пришел] to see her. And she used to like you so well.”

“I should have,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , сказал Валенси]  “But never mind. [never mind - неважно]  You couldn’t understand. The point is—you must have a housekeeper.”

“Where am I to get one? [get one - получить одну]  I can pay decent wages  [pay decent wages - платить достойную зарплату] if I could get  [could get - может получить] a decent woman. [decent woman - достойная женщина]  D’ye think I like old hags?”

“Will I do?” said Valancy.



 CHAPTER XV [chapter xv - глава xv] 

 “Let us be calm,” said Uncle Benjamin. “Let us be perfectly calm.”

“Calm!” Mrs. Frederick wrung  [frederick wrung - фредерик выжатый] her hands. “How can I be calm—how could anybody  [could anybody - может ли кто-нибудь] be calm under such a disgrace as this?”

“Why in the world did you let her go?” asked Uncle James.

“_Let_ her! How could I stop her, James? It seems she packed the big valise  [big valise - большой чемодан] and sent it away with Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий абель] when he went home  [went home - пошел домой] after supper, while Christine and I were out in the kitchen. Then Doss herself came down with her little satchel, [little satchel - маленький ранец]  dressed in her green serge suit. [green serge suit - зеленый саржевый костюм]  I felt a terrible premonition. [terrible premonition - ужасное предчувствие]  I can’t tell you how it was, but I seemed to _know_ that Doss was going to do something dreadful.”

“It’s a pity you couldn’t have had your premonition a little sooner,” said Uncle Benjamin drily.

“I said, ‘Doss, _where are you going_?’ and _she_ said, ‘I am going to look for my Blue Castle.’”

“Wouldn’t you think _that_ would convince Marsh that her mind is affected?” interjected Uncle James.

“And _I_ said, ‘Valancy, what _do_ you mean?’ And _she_ said, ‘I am going to keep house  [keep house - управлять домом] for Roaring Abel  [roaring abel -  ревущий авель] and nurse Cissy. [nurse cissy - няня Цисси]  He will pay me thirty dollars  [thirty dollars - тридцать долларов] a month.’ I wonder I didn’t drop dead  [drop dead - офигительно] on the spot.”

“You shouldn’t have let her go—you shouldn’t have let her out of the house,” said Uncle James. “You should have locked the door—anything——”

“She was between me and the front door. [front door - парадная дверь]  And you can’t realise how determined she was. She was like a rock. That’s the strangest thing  [strangest thing - странная вещь] of all about her. She used to be so good and obedient, and now she’s neither to hold nor bind. But I said _everything_ I could think  [could think - мог подумать] of to bring her to her senses. I asked her if she had no regard for her reputation. I said to her solemnly, ‘Doss, when a woman’s reputation is once smirched nothing  [smirched nothing - ничего не испачкал] can ever make  [ever make - когда-либо делала] it spotless again. Your character will be gone for ever if you go to Roaring Abel’s to wait on a bad girl  [bad girl - плохая девчонка] like Sis Gay.’ And she said, ‘I don’t believe Cissy  [believe cissy - верить цисси] was a bad girl, but I don’t care if she was.’ Those were her very words, ‘I don’t care if she was.’”

“She has lost all sense of decency,” exploded Uncle Benjamin.

“‘Cissy Gay is dying,’ she said, ‘and it’s a shame and disgrace that she is dying in a Christian community  [christian community - христианское сообщество] with no one to do anything for her. Whatever she’s been or done, she’s a human being.’”

“Well, you know, when it comes to that, I suppose she is,” said Uncle James with the air of one making  [one making - один делает] a splendid concession. [splendid concession - великолепная уступка] 

“I asked Doss  [asked doss - попросила постель] if she had no regard for appearances. She said, ‘I’ve been keeping up appearances all my life. Now I’m going in for realities. Appearances can go hang!’ Go _hang_!”

“An outrageous thing!” said Uncle Benjamin violently. “An outrageous thing!”

Which relieved his feelings, but didn’t help any one else. [one else - еще один] 

Mrs. Frederick wept. [frederick wept - фредерик плакал]  Cousin Stickles took  [cousin stickles took - двоюродный брат Стиклс взял] up the refrain between her moans of despair.

“I told her—we _both_ told her—that Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] had certainly killed  [certainly killed - конечно убит] his wife in one of his drunken rages  [drunken rages - пьяная ярость] and would kill  [would kill - убьет] her. She laughed and said, ‘I’m not afraid of Roaring Abel. He won’t kill _me_, and he’s too old for me to be afraid of his gallantries.’ What did she mean? What _are_ gallantries?”

Mrs. Frederick saw  [frederick saw - фредерик видел] that she must stop crying  [must stop crying - должен перестать плакать] if she wanted to regain control  [regain control - восстановить контроль] of the conversation.

“_I_ said to her, ‘Valancy, if you have no regard for your own reputation and your family’s standing, have you none for _my_ feelings?’ She said, ‘None.’ Just like that, ‘_None_!’”

“Insane people never _do_ have any regard for other people’s feelings,” said Uncle Benjamin. “That’s one of the symptoms.”

“I broke out into tears then, and she said, ‘Come now, Mother, be a good sport. [good sport - хороший спорт]  I’m going to do an act of Christian charity, [christian charity - христианская благотворительность]  and as for the damage it will do my reputation, why, you know I haven’t any matrimonial chances anyhow, [matrimonial chances anyhow - брачные шансы в любом случае]  so what does it matter?’ And with that she turned and went out.”

“The last words  [last words - последние слова] I said to her,” said Cousin Stickles pathetically, “were, ‘Who will rub my back at nights now?’ And she said—she said—but no, I cannot repeat  [cannot repeat - не могу повторять] it.”

“Nonsense,” said Uncle Benjamin. “Out with it. This is no time to be squeamish.”

“She said”—Cousin Stickles’ voice was little more than a whisper—“she said—‘Oh, _darn_!’”

“To think I should have lived to hear my daughter swearing!” sobbed Mrs. Frederick.

“It—it was only imitation swearing,” faltered Cousin Stickles, desirous of smoothing things  [smoothing things - сглаживание вещей] over now that the worst was out. But she had _never_ told about the bannister.

“It will be only a step from that to real swearing,” said Uncle James sternly.

“The worst of this”—Mrs. Frederick hunted  [frederick hunted - фредерик охотился] for a dry spot  [dry spot - сухое место] on her handkerchief—“is that every one  [every one - каждый одно] will know now that she is deranged. We can’t keep it a secret any longer. Oh, I cannot bear  [cannot bear - невыносим] it!”

“You should have been stricter with her when she was young,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“I don’t see how I could have been,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs - , – сказала миссис]  Frederick—truthfully enough.

“The worst feature  [worst feature - худшая черта] of the case is that Snaith scoundrel  [snaith scoundrel - снайт негодяй] is always hanging around Roaring Abel’s,” said Uncle James. “I shall be thankful if nothing worse comes  [nothing worse comes - ничего хуже] of this mad freak  [mad freak - безумный урод] than a few weeks at Roaring Abel’s. Cissy Gay _can’t_ live much longer.”

“And she didn’t even take  [even take - даже возьми] her flannel petticoat!” lamented Cousin Stickles.

“I’ll see Ambrose Marsh  [see ambrose marsh - посмотри на амброузское болото] again about this,” said Uncle Benjamin—meaning Valancy, not the flannel petticoat. [flannel petticoat - фланелевая нижняя юбка] 

“I’ll see Lawyer Ferguson,” said Uncle James.

“Meanwhile,” added Uncle Benjamin, “let us be calm.”



 CHAPTER XVI [chapter xvi - глава xvi] 

 Valancy had walked out to Roaring Abel’s house on the Mistawis road  [mistawis road - миставис-роуд] under a sky of purple and amber, with a queer exhilaration  [queer exhilaration - странное возбуждение] and expectancy in her heart. Back there, behind her, her mother and Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродные колючки] were crying—over themselves, not over her. But here the wind was in her face, soft, dew-wet, cool, blowing along  [blowing along - дует вперед] the grassy roads. [grassy roads - травянистые дороги]  Oh, she loved the wind! The robins were whistling sleepily  [whistling sleepily - сонный свист] in the firs along  [firs along - ели вдоль] the way and the moist air  [moist air - влажный воздух] was fragrant with the tang of balsam. Big cars went purring past in the violet dusk—the stream of summer tourists  [summer tourists - летние туристы] to Muskoka had already begun—but Valancy did not envy any of their occupants. Muskoka cottages might  [muskoka cottages might - коттеджи мускока могут] be charming, but beyond, in the sunset skies, [sunset skies - закатное небо]  among the spires of the firs, her Blue Castle towered. [blue castle towered - голубой замок возвышается ]  She brushed the old years  [old years - старые годы] and habits and inhibitions away  [inhibitions away - запреты прочь] from her like dead leaves. [like dead leaves - как мертвые листья]  She would not be littered with them.

Roaring Abel’s rambling, tumble-down old house  [old house - старый дом] was situated about three miles  [three miles - три мили] from the village, on the very edge of “up back,” as the sparsely settled, [sparsely settled - мало заселенный]  hilly, wooded country around Mistawis was called vernacularly. [called vernacularly -  называется на просторечии]  It did not, it must be confessed, look much like  [look much like - выглядит очень похоже] a Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок] 

Roaring Abel met Valancy at the door.

“So you’ve come,” he said incredulously. [said incredulously - сказал недоверчиво]  “I never s’posed that ruck of Stirlings would let  [stirlings would let - стирлинги позволили бы] you.”

Valancy showed  [valancy showed - валэнси показал] all her pointed teeth  [pointed teeth - острые зубы] in a grin.

“They couldn’t stop me.”

“I didn’t think you’d so much spunk,” said Roaring Abel admiringly. “And look at the nice ankles  [nice ankles - красивые лодыжки] of her,” he added, as he stepped aside  [stepped aside - отступили в сторону] to let her in.

If Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат Стиклз] had heard this she would have been certain that Valancy’s doom, earthly and unearthly, was sealed. But Abel’s superannuated gallantry  [superannuated gallantry - старая галантность] did not worry Valancy. [worry valancy - беспокойство валэнси]  Besides, this was the first compliment  [first compliment - первый комплимент] she had ever received  [ever received - когда-либо полученный] in her life and she found herself liking it. She sometimes suspected  [sometimes suspected - иногда подозревали] she had nice ankles, [nice ankles - красивые лодыжки]  but nobody had ever mentioned  [ever mentioned - когда-либо упоминавшийся] it before. In the Stirling clan ankles  [stirling clan ankles - лодыжки клана стерлингов] were among the unmentionables.

Roaring Abel took  [roaring abel took - ревущий Абель взял ] her into the kitchen, where Cissy Gay  [cissy gay - сисси-гей] was lying on the sofa, breathing quickly, [breathing quickly - часто дышу]  with little scarlet spots  [little scarlet spots - маленькие алые пятнышки] on her hollow cheeks. [hollow cheeks - впалые щеки]  Valancy had not seen Cecilia Gay  [seen cecilia gay - видела гей-сесилию] for years. Then she had been such a pretty creature, [pretty creature - милое создание]  a slight, blossom-like girl, [like girl - похоже на девушку]  with soft, golden hair, [golden hair - золотой волосы]  clear-cut, almost waxen features, [almost waxen features - почти восковые черты]  and large, beautiful blue eyes. [beautiful blue eyes - красивые голубые глаза]  She was shocked at the change in her. Could this be sweet Cissy—this pitiful little thing  [pitiful little thing - жалкая штучка] that looked like  [looked like - похоже] a tired, broken flower? [broken flower - сломанный цветок]  She had wept all the beauty out of her eyes; they looked too big—enormous—in her wasted face. [wasted face - исхудавшее лицо]  The last time Valancy  [last time valancy - последний раз валэнси] had seen Cecilia Gay those faded, piteous eyes  [piteous eyes - жалкие глаза] had been limpid, shadowy blue pools aglow with mirth. The contrast was so terrible that Valancy’s own eyes filled  [eyes filled - глаза наполнились] with tears. She knelt down by Cissy and put her arms about her.

“Cissy dear, I’ve come to look after you. I’ll stay with you till—till—as long as you want me.”

“Oh!” Cissy put her thin arms  [thin arms - тонкие руки] about Valancy’s neck. “Oh—_will_ you? It’s been so—lonely. I can wait on myself—but it’s been so _lonely_. It—would just be like—heaven—to have some one here—like you. You were always—so sweet to me—long ago.”

Valancy held Cissy close. She was suddenly happy. [suddenly happy - внезапно счастлив]  Here was some one who needed her—some one she could help. [could help - могут помочь]  She was no longer a superfluity. Old things  [old things - старые вещи] had passed away; [passed away - ушли]  everything had become new. [become new - стать новыми] 

“Most things are predestinated, but some are just darn sheer luck,” said Roaring Abel, complacently smoking  [complacently smoking - самодовольно курить] his pipe in the corner.



 CHAPTER XVII [chapter xvii - глава xvii] 

 When Valancy had lived for a week at Roaring Abel’s she felt as if years had separated her from her old life  [old life - старая жизнь] and all the people she had known in it. They were beginning to seem remote—dream-like—far-away—and as the days went  [days went - дни прошли] on they seemed still  [seemed still - казалось неподвижным] more so, until they ceased to matter altogether. [matter altogether - вообще материя] 

She was happy. Nobody ever bothered  [nobody ever bothered - никто никогда беспокоит] her with conundrums or insisted on giving her Purple Pills. [purple pills - фиолетовые таблетки]  Nobody called  [nobody called - никто не звонил] her Doss or worried her about catching cold. [catching cold - простуда]  There were no quilts to piece, no abominable rubber- [abominable rubber - отвратительная резина ] plant to water, no ice-cold maternal tantrums  [cold maternal tantrums - холодные материнские истерики] to endure. She could be alone whenever  [alone whenever - в одиночестве, когда] she liked, go to bed when she liked, sneeze when she liked. In the long, wondrous, northern twilights, [northern twilights - северные сумерки]  when Cissy was asleep and Roaring Abel away, [roaring abel away - ревущий авель прочь]  she could sit  [could sit - могла сидеть] for hours on the shaky back verandah steps, looking out over the barrens to the hills beyond, [hills beyond - холмы за пределами]  covered with their fine, purple bloom, [purple bloom - фиолетовый цвет]  listening to the friendly wind singing wild, sweet melodies  [sweet melodies - сладкие мелодии] in the little spruces, [little spruces - маленькие ели]  and drinking in the aroma of the sunned grasses, [sunned grasses - солнечные травы]  until darkness flowed  [darkness flowed - темнота текла] over the landscape like  [landscape like - пейзаж, похожий на] a cool, welcome wave. [welcome wave - приветственная волна] 

Sometimes of an afternoon, when Cissy was strong enough, [strong enough - достаточно сил]  the two girls went  [two girls went - две девушки пошли] into the barrens and looked at the wood-flowers. But they did not pick any. Valancy had read to Cissy the gospel thereof according  [gospel thereof according - евангелие этого согласно] to John Foster: [john foster - джон фостер]  “It is a pity to gather wood- [gather wood - собрать дрова] flowers. They lose half  [lose half - потерять половину] their witchery away  [witchery away - колдовству прочь] from the green and the flicker. The way to enjoy wood- [enjoy wood - наслаждаться дровами] flowers is to track them down to their remote haunts—gloat over them—and then leave them with backward glances, [backward glances - взгляды назад]  taking with us only the beguiling memory  [beguiling memory - обманчивое воспоминание] of their grace and fragrance.”

Valancy was in the midst of realities after a lifetime of unrealities. And busy—very busy. The house had to be cleaned. Not for nothing had Valancy been brought up in the Stirling habits  [stirling habits - привычки стирлинга] of neatness and cleanliness. If she found satisfaction  [found satisfaction - находил удовлетворение] in cleaning dirty rooms  [cleaning dirty rooms - уборка грязных комнат] she got her fill of it there. Roaring Abel thought  [roaring abel thought - ревущий авель мысли] she was foolish to bother doing so much more than she was asked to do, but he did not interfere with her. He was very well satisfied  [well satisfied - довольно] with his bargain. Valancy was a good cook. [good cook -  хороший повар]  Abel said  [abel said - авель сказал] she got a flavour into things. The only fault he found with her was that she did not sing at her work.

“Folks should always sing  [always sing - всегда петь] at their work,” he insisted. “Sounds cheerful-like.”

“Not always,” retorted Valancy. “Fancy a butcher singing  [butcher singing - мясник поет] at his work. Or an undertaker.”

Abel burst  [abel burst - всплеск абеля] into his great broad laugh. [great broad laugh - великолепно смеялся] 

“There’s no getting the better of you. You’ve got an answer every time. [answer every time - отвечать каждый раз]  I should think the Stirlings would  [stirlings would - стирлинги] be glad to be rid of you. _They_ don’t like being sassed back.”

During the day Abel  [day abel - день Авеля] was generally away  [generally away - обычно уезжали] from home—if not working, then shooting or fishing with Barney Snaith. [barney snaith - барни снайт]  He generally came home  [generally came home - обычно возвращались домой] at nights—always very late and often very drunk. The first night  [first night - первый вечер] they heard him come howling  [come howling - пришел вой] into the yard, Cissy had told Valancy  [told valancy - рассказывали Валэнси] not to be afraid.

“Father never does anything—he just makes a noise.”

Valancy, lying on the sofa in Cissy’s room, where she had elected to sleep, lest Cissy  [lest cissy - чтобы не цисси] should need attention  [need attention - нужно внимание] in the night—Cissy would never have called her—was not at all afraid, and said so. By the time Abel  [time abel - время авеля] had got his horses put away, [horses put away - лошади поставили прочь]  the roaring stage  [roaring stage - ревущая сцена] had passed and he was in his room at the end of the hall crying  [hall crying - зал плачет] and praying. Valancy could still hear his dismal moans  [dismal moans - унылые стоны] when she went calmly  [went calmly - пошли спокойно] to sleep. For the most part, Abel was a good-natured creature, [natured creature - природная тварь]  but occasionally he had a temper. Once Valancy asked  [valancy asked - валенси спросила] him coolly:

“What is the use of getting in a rage?”

“It’s such a d——d relief,” said Abel.

They both burst out laughing together. [laughing together - вместе смеемся] 

“You’re a great little sport,” said Abel admiringly. “Don’t mind my bad French. [bad french - плохой французский]  I don’t mean a thing by it. Jest habit. [jest habit - шутливая привычка]  Say, I like a woman that ain’t afraid to speak up to me. Sis there was always too meek—too meek. That’s why she got adrift. [got adrift - отплыли по течению]  I like you.”

“All the same,” said Valancy determinedly, “there is no use in sending things  [sending things - отсылка вещей] to hell as you’re always doing. And I’m _not_ going to have you tracking mud  [tracking mud - отслеживание грязи] all over a floor I’ve just scrubbed. You _must_ use the scraper whether  [scraper whether - скребок ли] you consign it to perdition or not.”

Cissy loved  [cissy loved - сисси любила] the cleanness and neatness. She had kept it so, too, until her strength failed. [strength failed - сила не удалась]  She was very pitifully happy  [pitifully happy - жалко счастливы] because she had Valancy with her. It had been so terrible—the long, lonely days  [lonely days - одинокие дни] and nights with no companionship save  [companionship save - сохранение дружбы] those dreadful old women  [dreadful old women -  ужасные старухи] who came to work. Cissy had hated and feared them. She clung to Valancy like  [valancy like - валентность как] a child.

There was no doubt that Cissy was dying. Yet at no time did she seem alarmingly ill. [seem alarmingly ill - кажется тревожно больной]  She did not even cough  [even cough - даже кашель] a great deal. [great deal - великолепно]  Most days she was able to get up and dress—sometimes even to work about in the garden or the barrens for an hour or two. For a few weeks after Valancy’s coming she seemed so much better  [much better - намного лучше] that Valancy began  [valancy began - валентность началась] to hope she might get well. [might get well - может выздороветь]  But Cissy shook  [cissy shook - Цисси тряслась] her head.

“I’m all right,” said Valancy lightly. She would not have Cissy worried. [cissy worried - Цисси волнуется]  “And I’m not working hard. [working hard - усердно работаю]  I’m glad to have some work to do—something that really wants  [really wants - действительно хочет] to be done.”

“Then”—Cissy slipped her hand wistfully  [hand wistfully - задумчивая рука] into Valancy’s—“don’t let’s talk any more about my being sick. Let’s just forget it. Let’s pretend I’m a little girl  [little girl - маленькая девочка] again—and you have come here to play with me. I used to wish that long ago—wish that you could come. [could come - могла прийти]  I knew you couldn’t, of course. But how I did wish it! You always seemed  [always seemed - всегда казалось] so different from the other girls—so kind and sweet—and as if you had something in yourself nobody knew  [nobody knew - никто не знал] about—some dear, pretty secret. [pretty secret - совершенно секретно]  _Had_ you, Valancy?”

“I had my Blue Castle, [blue castle - голубой замок] ” said Valancy, laughing a little. She was pleased that Cissy had thought of her like this. She had never suspected  [never suspected - никогда не подозревала] that anybody liked  [anybody liked - всем нравился] or admired or wondered about her. She told Cissy  [told cissy - говорила Цисси] all about her Blue Castle. She had never told  [never told - никогда не говорила] any one about it before.

“Every one  [every one - каждый] has a Blue Castle, [blue castle - голубой замок ]  I think,” said Cissy softly. “Only every one has a different name  [different name - разное имя] for it. _I_ had mine—once.”

She put her two thin little hands over her face. She did not tell Valancy—then—who had destroyed her Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  But Valancy knew  [valancy knew - валэнси знала] that, whoever it was, it was not Barney Snaith. [barney snaith - барни снайт] 



 CHAPTER XVIII [chapter xviii - глава xviii] 

 Valancy was acquainted with Barney by now—well acquainted, [well acquainted - хорошо знаком]  it seemed, though she had spoken to him only a few times. But then she had felt just as well acquainted with him the first time  [first time - первый раз] they had met. She had been in the garden at twilight, hunting for a few stalks of white narcissus  [white narcissus - белый нарцисс] for Cissy’s room when she heard that terrible old Grey Slosson coming down through the woods from Mistawis—one could hear it miles away. [miles away - мили отсюда]  Valancy did not look up as it drew near, [drew near - приблизился]  thumping over the rocks in that crazy lane. [crazy lane - сумасшедший переулок]  She had never looked  [never looked - никогда не смотрел] up, though Barney  [though barney - хотя Барни] had gone racketting past every evening since she had been at Roaring Abel’s. This time he did not racket past. [racket past - грохот мимо]  The old Grey Slosson stopped with even more terrible noises  [terrible noises - ужасные звуки] than it made going. [made going -  сделал движение]  Valancy was conscious that Barney had sprung from it and was leaning over the ramshackle gate. [ramshackle gate - ветхие ворота]  She suddenly straightened  [suddenly straightened - внезапно выпрямился] up and looked into his face. Their eyes met—Valancy was suddenly conscious  [suddenly conscious - внезапно в сознании] of a delicious weakness. [delicious weakness - вкусная слабость]  Was one of her heart attacks coming  [heart attacks coming - приближаются сердечные приступы] on?—But this was a new symptom. [new symptom - новый симптом] 

His eyes, which she had always thought brown, [always thought brown - всегда думал, что каштановые]  now seen close, [seen close - увидел вблизи]  were deep violet—translucent and intense. Neither of his eyebrows looked like  [eyebrows looked like - брови были похожи] the other. He was thin—too thin—she wished she could feed  [could feed - могу кормить] him up a bit—she wished she could sew  [could sew - могу шить] the buttons on his coat—and make him cut his hair—and shave every day. [shave every day - бреюсь каждый день]  There was _something_ in his face—one hardly knew what it was. Tiredness? Sadness? Disillusionment? He had dimples in his thin cheeks  [thin cheeks - тонкие щеки] when he smiled. All these thoughts flashed  [thoughts flashed - мысли мелькали] through Valancy’s mind in that one moment  [one moment - в один момент] while his eyes looked  [eyes looked - глаза смотрели] into hers.

“Good-evening, Miss Stirling.”

Nothing could  [nothing could - ничего не могло] be more commonplace and conventional. Any one might  [one might - можно] have said it. But Barney Snaith  [barney snaith - барни снайт] had a way of saying things  [saying things - говорить вещи] that gave them poignancy. When he said good- [said good - хорошо сказал] evening you felt that it _was_ a good evening  [good evening - добрый вечер] and that it was partly his doing that it was. Also, you felt that some of the credit was yours. Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валанти войлок ] all this vaguely, but she couldn’t imagine why she was trembling from head to foot—it _must_ be her heart. If only he didn’t notice it!

“I’m going over to the Port,” Barney was saying. “Can I acquire merit  [acquire merit - приобрести заслуги] by getting or doing anything there for you or Cissy?”

“Will you get some salt codfish  [salt codfish - соленая треска] for us?” said Valancy. It was the only thing she could think  [could think - мог подумать] of. Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] had expressed a desire that day for a dinner of boiled salt codfish. [boiled salt codfish - вареная соленая треска]  When her knights came riding  [knights came riding - рыцари приехали верхом] to the Blue Castle, [blue castle - голубой замок]  Valancy had sent them on many a quest, but she had never asked  [never asked - никогда не спрашивал] any of them to get her salt codfish.

“Certainly. You’re sure there’s nothing else? [nothing else - больше ничего]  Lots of room in Lady Jane Grey Slosson. And she always gets back _some_ time, does Lady Jane.”

“I don’t think there’s anything more,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , – сказала Валенси]  She knew he would bring oranges  [would bring oranges - не принесет апельсины] for Cissy anyhow—he always did.

Barney did not turn away  [turn away - отвернуться] at once. He was silent for a little. Then he said, slowly and whimsically:

“Miss Stirling, you’re a brick! You’re a whole cartload  [whole cartload - целая тележка] of bricks. To come here and look after Cissy—under the circumstances.”

“There’s nothing so bricky about that,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , – сказала Валенси]  “I’d nothing else  [nothing else - больше ничего] to do. And—I like it here. I don’t feel as if I’d done anything specially meritorious. Mr. Gay is paying me fair wages. [fair wages - справедливая заработная плата]  I never earned  [never earned - никогда не зарабатывал] any money before—and I like it.” It seemed so easy to talk to Barney Snaith, [barney snaith - барни снайт]  someway—this terrible Barney Snaith  [terrible barney snaith - ужасный барни снайт] of the lurid tales  [lurid tales - зловещие истории] and mysterious past—as easy and natural as if talking to herself.

“All the money in the world couldn’t buy what you’re doing for Cissy Gay,” said Barney. “It’s splendid and fine of you. And if there’s anything I can do to help you in any way, you have only to let me know. If Roaring Abel ever tries to annoy you——”

“He doesn’t. He’s lovely to me. I like Roaring Abel,” said Valancy frankly.

“So do I. But there’s one stage  [one stage - один этап] of his drunkenness—perhaps you haven’t encountered it yet—when he sings ribald songs——”

“Oh, yes. He came home last night like that. Cissy and I just went to our room and shut ourselves in where we couldn’t hear him. He apologised this morning. I’m not afraid of any of Roaring Abel’s stages.”

“Well, I’m sure he’ll be decent to you, apart from his inebriated yowls,” said Barney. “And I’ve told him he’s got to stop damning things  [stop damning things - прекратите проклинать вещи] when you’re around.”

“Why?” asked Valancy slily, with one of her odd, slanted glances  [slanted glances - косые взгляды] and a sudden flake  [sudden flake - внезапный обломок] of pink on each cheek, born of the thought that Barney Snaith  [barney snaith -  барни снайт] had actually done  [actually done - на самом деле сделано] so much for _her_. “I often feel like damning things myself.”

For a moment Barney stared. [moment barney stared - момент, когда барни уставился]  Was this elfin girl  [elfin girl - девушка-эльф] the little, old-maidish creature  [maidish creature - девичья тварь] who had stood there two minutes ago? [two minutes ago - две минуты назад]  Surely there was magic and devilry going  [devilry going - дьявол собирается] on in that shabby, weedy old garden. [weedy old garden - сорняк в старом саду] 

Then he laughed.

“It will be a relief to have some one to do it for you, then. So you don’t want anything  [want anything - хочу что-нибудь] but salt codfish?”

“Not tonight. But I dare say  [dare say - осмелюсь сказать] I’ll have some errands for you very often when you go to Port Lawrence. [port lawrence - порт лоуренсу]  I can’t trust Mr. [trust mr - доверьтесь мистеру]  Gay to remember to bring all the things I want.”

Barney had gone away, [gone away - ушла ]  then, in his Lady Jane, [lady jane - леди джейн]  and Valancy stood  [valancy stood - валэнси стояла] in the garden for a long time. [long time - долгое время] 

Since then he had called several times, [called several times - звонили несколько раз]  walking down through the barrens, whistling. How that whistle of his echoed through the spruces on those June twilights! [june twilights - июньские сумерки]  Valancy caught  [valancy caught - валэнси поймали] herself listening for it every evening—rebuked herself—then let herself go. Why shouldn’t she listen for it?

He always brought Cissy fruit and flowers. Once he brought Valancy  [brought valancy - принесла вэлэнси] a box of candy—the first box  [first box - первая коробка] of candy she had ever been given. It seemed sacrilege  [seemed sacrilege - казалось кощунством] to eat it.

She found herself thinking of him in season and out of season. She wanted to know if he ever thought  [ever thought - задумывался] about her when she wasn’t before his eyes, and, if so, what. She wanted to see that mysterious house  [mysterious house - таинственный дом] of his back on the Mistawis island. [mistawis island - остров миставис]  Cissy had never seen  [never seen - никогда не видел] it. Cissy, though she talked freely  [talked freely - свободно разговаривал] of Barney and had known him for five years, [five years - пять лет]  really knew little  [really knew little - действительно мало знал] more of him than Valancy herself.

“But he isn’t bad,” said Cissy. “Nobody need ever tell me he is. He _can’t_ have done a thing to be ashamed of.”

“Then why does he live as he does?” asked Valancy—to hear somebody defend  [hear somebody defend - слышу, как кто-то защищает] him.

“I don’t know. He’s a mystery. And of course there’s something behind  [something behind -  что-то позади] it, but I _know_ it isn’t disgrace. Barney Snaith simply  [barney snaith simply - барни снайт просто] couldn’t do anything disgraceful, [anything disgraceful - что-нибудь безобразное]  Valancy.”

Valancy was not so sure. Barney must  [barney must - барни должен] have done _something_—sometime. He was a man of education and intelligence. She had soon discovered  [soon discovered - скоро обнаружили] that, in listening to his conversations and wrangles with Roaring Abel—who was surprisingly well read  [surprisingly well read - на удивление хорошо начитанное] and could discuss  [could discuss - можно обсудить] any subject under the sun when sober. Such a man wouldn’t bury himself for five years  [five years - пять лет] in Muskoka and live and look like  [look like - похоже] a tramp if there were not too good—or bad—a reason for it. But it didn’t matter. All that mattered was that she was sure now that he had never been Cissy Gay’s lover. There was nothing like _that_ between them. Though he was very fond of Cissy and she of him, as any one could see. [one could see - можно было увидеть]  But it was a fondness that didn’t worry Valancy. [worry valancy - беспокойство валентность] 

“You don’t know what Barney has been to me, these past two years,” Cissy had said simply. [said simply - сказал просто]  “_Everything_ would have been unbearable without  [unbearable without - невыносим без] him.”

“Cissy Gay is the sweetest girl  [sweetest girl - самая милая девушка] I ever knew—and there’s a man somewhere  [man somewhere - мужчину где-то] I’d like to shoot if I could find  [could find - мог найти] him,” Barney  [,” barney -  », барни] had said savagely. [said savagely - сказал дико] 

If he were telling the truth. But Valancy knew  [valancy knew - вэлэнси знала] he was.

“Found no gold,” he said. “Came away poorer than when I went. But such a place to live! Those silences at the back of the north wind _got_ me. I’ve never belonged  [never belonged - никогда не принадлежала] to myself since.”

Yet he was not a great talker. [great talker - великолепный болтун]  He told a great deal  [great deal - много] in a few well-chosen words—how well-chosen Valancy  [chosen valancy - выбрала вэлэнси] did not realise. And he had a knack of saying things without opening his mouth at all.

“I like a man whose eyes say more than his lips,” thought Valancy.

But then she liked everything  [liked everything - все нравилось] about him—his tawny hair—his whimsical smiles—the little glints  [little glints - маленькие блики] of fun in his eyes—his loyal affection  [loyal affection - верная привязанность] for that unspeakable Lady Jane—his habit of sitting with his hands in his pockets, his chin sunk  [chin sunk - подбородок опущен] on his breast, looking up from under his mismated eyebrows. [mismated eyebrows - неправильно сдвинутые брови]  She liked his nice voice  [nice voice - приятный голос] which sounded as if it might become caressing  [might become caressing - может стать лаской] or wooing with very little provocation. [little provocation - небольшая провокация]  She was at times almost afraid  [times almost afraid - времена почти боялись] to let herself think these thoughts. They were so vivid that she felt as if the others _must_ know what she was thinking.

“I’ve been watching a woodpecker all day,” he said one evening  [said one evening - рассказал однажды вечером] on the shaky old back verandah. His account of the woodpecker’s doings was satisfying. He had often some gay or cunning little anecdote  [cunning little anecdote - хитрый маленький анекдот] of the wood folk  [wood folk - лесной народ] to tell them. And sometimes he and Roaring Abel smoked fiercely the whole evening  [whole evening - весь вечер] and never said  [never said - никогда не говорил] a word, while Cissy lay  [cissy lay - нежно лежал] in the hammock swung  [hammock swung - качался гамак] between the verandah posts  [verandah posts - столбы веранды] and Valancy sat idly  [valancy sat idly - валэнси сидела сложа руки] on the steps, her hands clasped  [hands clasped - руки сцеплены] over her knees, and wondered dreamily  [wondered dreamily - мечтательно размышлял] if she were really Valancy Stirling  [really valancy stirling - на самом деле валенси стирлинг] and if it were only three weeks since  [three weeks since - три недели с тех пор] she had left the ugly old house  [ugly old house - уродливая старая дом] on Elm Street. [elm street - улица вязов] 

The barrens lay  [barrens lay - лежали пустоши] before her in a white moon splendour, [white moon splendour - великолепие белой луны]  where dozens of little rabbits frisked. [little rabbits frisked - маленький кролики обысканы]  Barney, when he liked, could sit  [could sit - мог сидеть] down on the edge of the barrens and lure those rabbits right  [rabbits right - кролики правы] to him by some mysterious sorcery  [mysterious sorcery - таинственное волшебство] he possessed. Valancy had once seen a squirrel leap  [squirrel leap - прыжок белки] from a scrub pine  [scrub pine - кустарник сосны] to his shoulder and sit there chattering to him. It reminded her of John Foster. [john foster - джон фостер] 

It was one of the delights of Valancy’s new life  [new life - новая жизнь] that she could read  [could read - мог читать] John Foster’s books as often and as long as she liked. She could read them in bed if she wanted to. She read them all to Cissy, who loved them. She also tried  [also tried - также пытался] to read them to Abel and Barney, who did not love them. Abel was bored and Barney politely refused  [barney politely refused - барни вежливо отказался] to listen at all.

“Piffle,” said Barney.



 CHAPTER XIX [chapter xix - глава xix] 

 Of course, the Stirlings had not left the poor maniac alone  [poor maniac alone - бедный маньяк в одиночестве] all this time or refrained from heroic efforts  [heroic efforts - героические усилия] to rescue her perishing soul  [perishing soul - гибнущую душу] and reputation. Uncle James, [uncle james - дядя джеймс]  whose lawyer  [whose lawyer - чей адвокат] had helped him as little as his doctor, came one day  [came one day - пришел один день] and, finding Valancy alone  [finding valancy alone - в поисках валэнси в одиночку] in the kitchen, as he supposed, gave her a terrible talking- [terrible talking - ужасно говорит] to—told her she was breaking her mother’s heart and disgracing her family.

“But _why_?” said Valancy, not ceasing to scour her porridge pot decently. [porridge pot decently - кастрюлю с кашей прилично]  “I’m doing honest work  [honest work - честная работа] for honest pay. [honest pay - честная оплата]  What is there in that that is disgraceful?”

“Don’t quibble, Valancy,” said Uncle James solemnly. “This is no fit place  [fit place - подходящее место] for you to be, and you know it. Why, I’m told that jail-bird, Snaith, is hanging around  [hanging around - шляется] here every evening.”

“Not _every_ evening,” said Valancy reflectively. “No, not quite every evening.”

“It’s—it’s insufferable!” said Uncle James violently. “Valancy, you _must_ come home. We won’t judge your harshly. I assure you we won’t. We will overlook all this.”

“Thank you,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , — сказала Валенси] 

“Have you no sense of shame?” demanded Uncle James.

“Oh, yes. But the things _I_ am ashamed of are not the things _you_ are ashamed of.” Valancy proceeded  [.” valancy proceeded - . valancy продолжался] to rinse her dishcloth meticulously. [dishcloth meticulously - тщательно тряпка для мытья посуды] 

Still was Uncle James patient. [uncle james patient - дядя джеймс терпелив]  He gripped the sides of his chair and ground his teeth.

“We know your mind isn’t just right. We’ll make allowances. [make allowances - сделать скидку]  But you _must_ come home. You shall not stay here with that drunken, blasphemous old scoundrel——”

“Were you by any chance referring  [chance referring - случайный отсыл] to _me_, _Mister_ Stirling?” demanded Roaring Abel, suddenly appearing  [suddenly appearing - внезапно появившийся] in the doorway of the back verandah  [back verandah - задняя веранда] where he had been smoking a peaceful pipe  [peaceful pipe - мирная трубка] and listening to “old Jim Stirling’s” tirade  [” tirade - ” тирада] with huge enjoyment! [huge enjoyment - огромное удовольствие]  His red beard fairly bristled with indignation and his huge eyebrows quivered. [huge eyebrows quivered - огромные брови вздрогнули]  But cowardice was not among James Stirling’s shortcomings.

“I was. And, furthermore, I want to tell you that you have acted an iniquitous part  [iniquitous part - несправедливая часть] in luring this weak and unfortunate girl away  [unfortunate girl away - несчастная девушка далеко] from her home and friends, and I will have you punished yet  [punished yet - наказана еще] for it——”

James Stirling got  [james stirling got - джеймс стирлинг получил] no further. Roaring Abel crossed  [roaring abel crossed - ревущий абель скрещенный] the kitchen at a bound, caught him by his collar and his trousers, and hurled him through the doorway and over the garden paling  [garden paling - садовый частокол] with as little apparent effort  [little apparent effort - мало видимых усилий] as he might have employed in whisking a troublesome kitten  [troublesome kitten - проблемный котенок] out of the way.

“The next time  [next time - в следующий раз] you come back  [come back - вернись] here,” he bellowed, “I’ll throw you through the window—and all the better if the window is shut! Coming here, thinking yourself God to put the world to rights!”

Valancy candidly  [valancy candidly - валэнси откровенно ] and unashamedly owned  [unashamedly owned - наглый владелец] to herself that she had seen few more satisfying sights  [satisfying sights - удовлетворяющие взгляды] than Uncle James’ coat-tails flying  [tails flying - хвосты развевались] out into the asparagus bed. [asparagus bed - спаржевая грядка]  She had once been afraid of this man’s judgment. Now she saw clearly  [saw clearly - видел ясно] that he was nothing but a rather stupid little village tin-god.

Roaring Abel turned  [roaring abel turned - ревущий авель повернулся] with his great broad laugh. [great broad laugh - великолепный широкий смех] 

“He’ll think of that for years when he wakes up in the night. The Almighty made  [almighty made - всемогущее создание] a mistake in making so many Stirlings. [many stirlings - много стирлингов]  But since they are made, we’ve got to reckon with them. Too many to kill out. But if they come here bothering you I’ll shoo ’em off before a cat could lick  [cat could lick - кошка могла лизнуть] its ear.”

The next time  [next time - в следующий раз ] they sent Dr. [sent dr - послал доктора]  Stalling. Surely Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] would not throw him into asparagus beds. [asparagus beds - грядки со спаржей]  Dr. Stalling was not so sure of this and had no great liking  [great liking - большая симпатия] for the task. He did not believe Valancy Stirling  [believe valancy stirling - верю вэлэнси стерлинг] was out of her mind. She had always been queer. He, Dr. Stalling, had never been able to understand her. Therefore, beyond doubt, [beyond doubt - вне сомнения]  she was queer. She was only just a little queerer  [little queerer - маленький чудак] than usual now. And Dr. Stalling had his own reasons for disliking Roaring Abel. [disliking roaring abel - не любит ревущего авеля]  When Dr. Stalling had first come  [first come - пришел первым] to Deerwood he had had a liking for long hikes around Mistawis and Muskoka. On one of these occasions he had got lost  [got lost - заблудился] and after much wandering  [much wandering - много странствий] had fallen in with Roaring Abel with his gun over his shoulder.

Dr. Stalling had contrived to ask his question in about the most idiotic manner possible. [idiotic manner possible - возможен идиотский способ]  He said, “Can you tell me where I’m going?”

“How the devil should I know where you’re going, gosling?” retorted Abel contemptuously.

Dr. Stalling was so enraged that he could not speak for a moment or two and in that moment Abel  [moment abel - момент с абелем] had disappeared in the woods. Dr. Stalling had eventually found  [eventually found - в конце концов нашел] his way home, [way home - путь домой]  but he had never hankered  [never hankered - никогда не страстно желал] to encounter Abel Gay  [encounter abel gay - встреча с геем с абелем] again.

Nevertheless he came now to do his duty. Valancy greeted  [valancy greeted - валэнси приветствовали] him with a sinking heart. [sinking heart - замирающее сердце]  She had to own to herself that she was terribly afraid  [terribly afraid - ужасно боялся] of Dr. Stalling still. [stalling still - стоял на месте ]  She had a miserable conviction  [miserable conviction - жалкое убеждение] that if he shook his long, bony finger  [bony finger - костяной палец] at her and told her to go home, [go home - иди домой]  she dared not disobey.

“Mr. Gay,” said Dr. Stalling politely  [stalling politely - вежливо останавливаюсь] and condescendingly, “may I see Miss Stirling alone for a few minutes?”

Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий абель] was a little drunk—just drunk enough  [drunk enough - достаточно пьяный] to be excessively polite  [excessively polite - чрезмерно вежливый] and very cunning. He had been on the point of going away  [going away - уходя] when Dr. Stalling arrived, [stalling arrived - остановка прибыла]  but now he sat down in a corner of the parlour and folded his arms.

“No, no, mister,” he said solemnly. [said solemnly - торжественно сказал]  “That wouldn’t do—wouldn’t do at all. I’ve got the reputation of my household to keep up. I’ve got to chaperone this young lady. [young lady - молодая леди]  Can’t have any sparkin’ going on here behind my back.”

Outraged Dr. [outraged dr - возмущенный доктор]  Stalling looked  [stalling looked - остановился посмотрел] so terrible that Valancy wondered  [valancy wondered - валенси удивился] how Abel could endure  [abel could endure - авель мог вытерпеть] his aspect. But Abel was not worried at all.

“D’ye know anything about it, anyway?” he asked genially. [asked genially -  спросил добродушно] 

“About _what_?”

“Sparking,” said Abel coolly.

“Miss Stirling, I am here in response to your mother’s wishes. She begged me to come. I am charged with some messages from her. Will you”—he wagged his forefinger—“will you hear them?”

“Yes,” said Valancy faintly, eyeing the forefinger. It had a hypnotic effect  [hypnotic effect - гипнотический эффект] on her.

“The first is this. If you will leave this—this——”

“House,” interjected Roaring Abel. “H-o-u-s-e. Troubled with an impediment in your speech, ain’t you, Mister?”

“—this _place_ and return to your home, Mr. James Stirling  [james stirling - джеймс стирлинг] will himself pay for a good nurse  [good nurse - хорошая медсестра] to come here and wait on Miss Gay.”

Back of her terror Valancy smiled  [terror valancy smiled - ужас вэлэнси улыбнулась] in secret. Uncle James must indeed regard the matter as desperate when he would loosen  [would loosen - ослабит] his purse-strings like  [strings like - нити как] that. At any rate, her clan no longer despised  [longer despised - больше презирают] her or ignored her. She had become important  [become important - станут важными] to them.

“That’s _my_ business, Mister,” said Abel. “Miss Stirling can go if she pleases, or stay if she pleases. I made a fair bargain  [fair bargain - честная сделка] with her, and she’s free to conclude it when she likes. She gives me meals that stick to my ribs. She don’t forget to put salt  [put salt - посолить] in the porridge. She never slams doors, [never slams doors - никогда не хлопает дверями]  and when she has nothing to say she don’t talk. That’s uncanny in a woman, you know, Mister. I’m satisfied. If she isn’t, she’s free to go. But no woman comes  [woman comes - женщина приходит] here in Jim Stirling’s pay. If any one does”—Abel’s voice was uncannily bland  [uncannily bland - сверхъестественно мягкая] and polite—“I’ll spatter the road with her brains. Tell him that with A. Gay’s compliments.”

“Dr. Stalling, a nurse is not what Cissy needs,” said Valancy earnestly. “She isn’t so ill as that, yet. What she wants is companionship—somebody she knows and likes just to live with her. You can understand that, I’m sure.”

“I understand that your motive is quite—ahem—commendable.” Dr. Stalling felt  [stalling felt - задерживающийся войлок] that he was very broad-minded indeed—especially as in his secret soul  [secret soul - тайная душа] he did not believe Valancy’s motive _was_ commendable. He hadn’t the least idea  [least idea -  малейшая идея] what she was up to, but he was sure her motive was not commendable. When he could not understand a thing he straightway condemned  [straightway condemned - прямо осужден] it. Simplicity itself! “But your first duty  [first duty - первая обязанность] is to your mother. _She_ needs you. She implores you to come home—she will forgive everything  [forgive everything - простить все] if you will only come home.”

“That’s a pretty little thought,” remarked Abel meditatively, as he ground some tobacco up in his hand.

Dr. Stalling ignored  [stalling ignored - задержка проигнорирована] him.

“She entreats, but I, Miss Stirling,”—Dr. Stalling remembered  [stalling remembered - задержка вспомнила] that he was an ambassador of Jehovah—“_I command_. As your pastor and spiritual guide, [spiritual guide - духовный наставник]  I command you to come home  [come home - прийти домой] with me—this very day. Get your hat and coat and come _now_.”

Dr. Stalling shook  [stalling shook - задержка тряслась] his finger at Valancy. Before that pitiless finger  [pitiless finger - безжалостный палец] she drooped and wilted visibly. [wilted visibly - заметно поникла] 

“She’s giving in,” thought Roaring Abel. “She’ll go with him. Beats all, the power these preacher fellows  [preacher fellows - парни-проповедники] have over women.”

Valancy _was_ on the point of obeying Dr. [obeying dr - подчиняясь доктору]  Stalling. She must go home  [must go home - должны вернуться домой] with him—and give up. She would lapse back  [would lapse back - отступили бы назад] to Doss Stirling  [doss stirling - досс стирлинг] again and for her few remaining days  [remaining days - оставшиеся дни] or weeks be the cowed, futile creature  [futile creature - бесполезная тварь] she had always been. It was her fate—typified by that relentless, uplifted forefinger. [uplifted forefinger - поднятый указательный палец]  She could no more escape from it than Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель ] from his predestination. She eyed it as the fascinated bird eyes  [fascinated bird eyes - восторженные птичьи глаза] the snake. Another moment—

“_Fear is the original sin_,” suddenly said a still, small voice away back—back—back of Valancy’s consciousness. “_Almost all the evil in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something_.”

Valancy stood  [valancy stood - валенси стоял] up. She was still in the clutches of fear, but her soul was her own again. She would not be false to that inner voice. [inner voice - внутренний голос] 

“Dr. Stalling,” she said slowly, [said slowly - говорил медленно]  “I do not at present owe _any_ duty to my mother. She is quite well; [quite well - вполне хорошо]  she has all the assistance and companionship she requires; she does not need me at all. I _am_ needed here. I am going to stay here.”

“There’s spunk for you,” said Roaring Abel admiringly.

Dr. Stalling dropped  [stalling dropped - сваливание отпало] his forefinger. One could  [one could - можно] not keep on shaking a finger forever. [finger forever - палец навсегда] 

“Miss Stirling, is there _nothing_ that can influence you? Do you remember your childhood days——”

“Perfectly. And hate them.”

“Do you realise what people will say? What they _are_ saying?”

“I can imagine it,” said Valancy, [,” said valancy - , – сказала вэлэнси]  with a shrug of her shoulders. She was suddenly free  [suddenly free - внезапно освободилась] of fear again. “I haven’t listened to the gossip of Deerwood teaparties  [deerwood teaparties - чаепития из оленьего дерева] and sewing circles twenty years for nothing. But, Dr. Stalling, it doesn’t matter in the least to me what they say—not in the least.”

Dr. Stalling went away  [stalling went away - стойл ушел] then. A girl who cared nothing  [cared nothing - ничего не заботился] for public opinion! [public opinion - общественное мнение]  Over whom sacred family ties  [sacred family ties - священный семейные узы] had no restraining influence! [restraining influence - сдерживающее влияние]  Who hated her childhood memories! [childhood memories - детские воспоминания] 

Then Cousin Georgiana  [cousin georgiana - двоюродный брат Джорджиана] came—on her own initiative, for nobody would  [nobody would - никто бы не стал] have thought it worth while to send her. She found Valancy alone, [found valancy alone - нашла вэланси в одиночестве]  weeding the little vegetable garden  [little vegetable garden - маленький огород] she had planted, and she made all the platitudinous pleas  [platitudinous pleas - банальные мольбы] she could think  [could think - мог бы подумать] of. Valancy heard  [valancy heard - вэлэнси услышала] her patiently. Cousin Georgiana wasn’t such a bad old soul. [bad old soul - плохая старая душа]  Then she said:

“And now that you have got all that out of your system, Cousin Georgiana, [cousin georgiana - кузен Джорджиана]  can you tell me how to make creamed codfish  [make creamed codfish - приготовить треску со сливками] so that it will not be as thick as porridge and as salt as the Dead Sea?”

* * * * * * *

“We’ll just have to _wait_,” said Uncle Benjamin. “After all, Cissy Gay  [cissy gay - нежно-гей] can’t live long. [live long - жить долго]  Dr. Marsh tells  [marsh tells - болото говорит] me she may drop  [may drop - может падение] off any day.”

Mrs. Frederick wept. [frederick wept - фредерик плакал]  It would really  [would really - было бы действительно] have been so much easier  [much easier - намного легче] to bear if Valancy had died. She could have worn mourning  [worn mourning - носил траур] then.



 CHAPTER XX [chapter xx - глава xx] 

 When Abel Gay paid Valancy her first month’s wages—which he did promptly, in bills reeking  [bills reeking - вонючие купюры] with the odour of tobacco and whiskey—Valancy went into Deerwood and spent every cent  [spent every cent - потратил каждый цент] of it. She got a pretty green crêpe dress with a girdle of crimson beads, [crimson beads - малиновые бусы]  at a bargain sale, [bargain sale - распродажа]  a pair of silk stockings, [silk stockings - шелковые чулки]  to match, and a little crinkled green hat with a crimson rose  [crimson rose - малиновая роза] in it. She even bought  [even bought - даже купил] a foolish little beribboned  [foolish little beribboned - глупая маленькая ленточка] and belaced nightgown. [belaced nightgown - расслабился ночная рубашка] 

She passed the house on Elm Street twice—Valancy never even thought about it as “home”—but saw no one. No doubt her mother was sitting in the room this lovely June evening playing solitaire—and cheating. Valancy knew  [valancy knew - валэнси знала] that Mrs. Frederick always cheated. [frederick always cheated - фредерик всегда обманывал]  She never lost  [never lost - никогда не терял] a game. Most of the people Valancy met looked at her seriously and passed her with a cool nod. [cool nod - крутой кивок]  Nobody stopped  [nobody stopped - никто не останавливался] to speak to her.

Valancy put  [valancy put - valancy put] on her green dress  [green dress - зеленое платье] when she got home. [got home - пришел домой]  Then she took it off again. She felt so miserably undressed  [miserably undressed - ужасно раздетый] in its low neck  [low neck - декольте] and short sleeves. [short sleeves - короткие рукава]  And that low, crimson girdle around  [crimson girdle around - малиновый пояс вокруг] the hips seemed positively indecent. She hung it up in the closet, feeling flatly  [feeling flatly - чувство себя плоско] that she had wasted her money. She would never  [would never - никогда бы не ] have the courage to wear that dress. John Foster’s arraignment of fear had no power to stiffen her against this. In this one thing habit  [one thing habit - одна привычка] and custom were still all-powerful. Yet she sighed as she went down to meet Barney Snaith  [meet barney snaith - познакомьтесь с барни снайтом] in her old snuff- [old snuff - старый табак] brown silk. [brown silk - коричневый шелк]  That green thing  [green thing - зеленая штука] had been very becoming—she had seen so much in her one ashamed glance. [one ashamed glance - один пристыженный взгляд]  Above it her eyes had looked like odd brown jewels and the girdle had given her flat figure  [flat figure - плоская фигура] an entirely different appearance. [entirely different appearance - совершенно другая внешность]  She wished she could have left it on. But there were some things John Foster  [things john foster - вещи джон фостер] did not know.

Oddly enough, [oddly enough - достаточно странно]  Roaring Abel disapproved  [roaring abel disapproved - ревущий авель не одобрял] of her going to the hill church  [hill church - горная церковь] as strongly as Mrs. Frederick herself could have done. He had “no use for Free Methodists. [free methodists - свободные методисты]  He was a Presbyterian.” But Valancy went  [valancy went - валэнси пошел] in spite of him.

“We’ll hear something worse  [hear something worse - слышать кое-что похуже] than _that_ about her soon,” Uncle Benjamin predicted gloomily.

They did.

Valancy could  [valancy could - валенси могла] not quite explain, [quite explain - вполне объяснить]  even to herself, just why she wanted to go to that party. It was a dance “u [dance “ - танцевать «] p back” at Chidley Corners; [chidley corners - чидли-корне]  and dances at Chidley Corners were not, as a rule, the sort of assemblies where well-brought-up young ladies  [young ladies - юные леди] were found. Valancy knew  [valancy knew - валэнси знала] it was coming off, for Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] had been engaged as one of the fiddlers.

But the idea of going had never occurred  [never occurred - никогда не было] to her until Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] himself broached it at supper.

“You come with me to the dance,” he ordered. “It’ll do you good—put some colour in your face. You look peaked—you want something  [want something - хочу чего-то] to liven you up.”

Valancy found  [valancy found - валентность найдена] herself suddenly wanting  [suddenly wanting - внезапно захотелось] to go. She knew nothing  [knew nothing - ничего не знал] at all of what dances at Chidley Corners  [chidley corners - чидли уголки] were apt to be like. Her idea of dances had been fashioned on the correct affairs  [correct affairs - правильные дела] that went by that name in Deerwood and Port Lawrence. [port lawrence - порт лоуренс]  Of course she knew the Corners’ dance wouldn’t be just like them. Much more informal, of course. But so much the more interesting. Why shouldn’t she go? Cissy was in a week of apparent health  [apparent health - видимое здоровье] and improvement. She wouldn’t mind staying alone  [mind staying alone -  разум остаться в одиночестве] in the least. She entreated Valancy  [entreated valancy - умоляла валентность] to go if she wanted to. And Valancy _did_ want to go.

She went to her room to dress. A rage against the snuff-brown silk seized  [brown silk seized - коричневый шелк изъяли] her. Wear that to a party! Never. She pulled her green crêpe  [green crêpe - зеленый креп] from its hanger and put it on feverishly. It was nonsense to feel so—so—naked—just because her neck and arms were bare. That was just her old maidishness. [old maidishness - старая дева]  She would not be ridden by it. On went the dress—the slippers.

It was the first time  [first time - первый раз ] she had worn a pretty dress since  [pretty dress since - красивое платье с тех пор] the organdies of her early teens. [early teens - ранние подростки]  And _they_ had never made  [never made - никогда не шили] her look like  [look like - выглядят как] this.

If she only had a necklace or something. She wouldn’t feel so bare then. She ran down to the garden. There were clovers there—great crimson things growing in the long grass. [long grass - длинная трава]  Valancy gathered handfuls  [valancy gathered handfuls - валэнси собрала горсти] of them and strung them on a cord. Fastened above her neck they gave her the comfortable sensation  [comfortable sensation - удобное ощущение] of a collar and were oddly becoming. [oddly becoming - странно становящаяся]  Another circlet  [another circlet - еще ​​один обруч] of them went round  [went round - пошла кругом] her hair, dressed in the low puffs  [low puffs - низкие пуховки] that became her. Excitement brought  [excitement brought - возбуждение принесло] those faint pink stains  [faint pink stains - бледные розовые пятна] to her face. She flung on her coat and pulled the little, twisty hat  [twisty hat - кривая шляпа] over her hair.

“You look so nice and—and—different, dear,” said Cissy. “Like a green moonbeam  [green moonbeam - зеленый лунный луч] with a gleam of red in it, if there could be such a thing.”

Valancy stooped  [valancy stooped - валэнси сгорбилась] to kiss her.

“I don’t feel right  [feel right - чувствую себя хорошо] about leaving you alone, Cissy.”

“Oh, I’ll be all right. I feel better tonight  [feel better tonight - чувствую себя лучше сегодня вечером] than I have for a long while. I’ve been feeling badly  [feeling badly - плохо себя чувствую] to see you sticking here so closely on my account. I hope you’ll have a nice time. [nice time - хорошее время]  I never was at a party at the Corners, but I used to go sometimes, [go sometimes - хожу иногда]  long ago, [long ago - давным-давно]  to dances up back. We always had good times. [good times - хорошее время]  And you needn’t be afraid of Father being drunk tonight. [drunk tonight - пьяный сегодня вечером]  He never drinks  [never drinks - никогда не пью] when he engages to play for a party. But—there may be—liquor. What will you do if it gets rough?”

“Nobody would molest me.”

“Not seriously, I suppose. Father would see  [father would see - отец увидит] to that. But it _might_ be noisy and—and unpleasant.”

“I won’t mind. I’m only going as a looker-on. I don’t expect to dance. I just want to _see_ what a party up back is like. I’ve never seen anything except decorous Deerwood.”

Cissy smiled rather dubiously. She knew much better  [knew much better - знал намного лучше] than Valancy what a party “u [party “ - вечеринка «] p back” might be like if there should be liquor. But again there mightn’t be.

“I hope you’ll enjoy it, dear,” she repeated.

Valancy enjoyed  [valancy enjoyed - валэнси наслаждалась] the drive there. They went early, [went early - пошла рано]  for it was twelve miles  [twelve miles - двенадцать миль] to Chidley Corners, [chidley corners - чидли уголки]  and they had to go in Abel’s old, ragged top- [ragged top - рваная вершина] buggy. The road was rough and rocky, like most Muskoka roads, [muskoka roads - мускока дороги]  but full of the austere charm  [austere charm - суровое очарование] of northern woods. [northern woods - северный леса]  It wound through beautiful, purring pines  [purring pines - мурлыкающие сосны] that were ranks of enchantment in the June sunset, [june sunset - июньский закат]  and over the curious jade- [curious jade - любопытный нефрит] green rivers  [green rivers - зеленые реки] of Muskoka, fringed by aspens that were always quivering  [always quivering - всегда трепетно] with some supernal joy. [supernal joy - неземная радость] 

Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] was excellent company, [excellent company - отличная компания]  too. He knew all the stories and legends of the wild, beautiful “u [beautiful “ -  красивая «] p back,” and he told them to Valancy as they drove along. [drove along - прокатились]  Valancy had several fits  [several fits - несколько приступов] of inward laughter  [inward laughter - внутренний смех] over what Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] and Aunt Wellington, [aunt wellington - тетя Веллингтон]  _et al._, would feel  [would feel - будет чувствовать] and think and say if they saw her driving with Roaring Abel in that terrible buggy  [terrible buggy - ужасная коляска] to a dance at Chidley Corners. [chidley corners - чидли уголки] 

At first the dance was quiet enough, [quiet enough - достаточно тихо]  and Valancy was amused and entertained. She even danced twice  [even danced twice - даже дважды танцевала] herself, with a couple of nice “u [nice “ - приятно «] p back” boys who danced beautifully  [danced beautifully - красиво танцевала] and told her she did, too.

Another compliment came  [another compliment came - пришел еще один комплимент] her way—not a very subtle one, [subtle one - тонкий один]  perhaps, but Valancy had had too few compliments in her life to be over-nice on that point. She overheard two  [overheard two - подслушал два] of the “up back” young men talking about her in the dark “lean-to” behind  [” behind - » позади] her.

“Know who that girl in green is?”

“Nope. Guess she’s from out front. The Port, maybe. Got a stylish look  [stylish look - стильный взгляд] to her.”

“No beaut but cute-looking, I’ll say. ‘Jever see such eyes?”

The big room  [big room - большая комната] was decorated with pine and fir boughs, [fir boughs - еловые ветки]  and lighted by Chinese lanterns. [chinese lanterns - китайские фонарики]  The floor was waxed, and Roaring Abel’s fiddle, purring under his skilled touch, [skilled touch - искусное прикосновение]  worked magic. [worked magic - колдунство]  The “up back” girls were pretty and prettily dressed. [prettily dressed - красиво одетый]  Valancy thought  [valancy thought - валентность мысли] it the nicest party  [nicest party - самая милая вечеринка] she had ever attended. [ever attended - всегда посещаемый] 

By eleven o’clock she had changed her mind. A new crowd  [new crowd - новый толпа] had arrived—a crowd unmistakably drunk. [crowd unmistakably drunk - толпа безошибочно пьяная]  Whiskey began  [whiskey began - виски началось] to circulate freely. [circulate freely -  циркулировать свободно]  Very soon almost  [soon almost - скоро почти] all the men were partly drunk. [partly drunk - частично пьяный]  Those in the porch and outside around  [outside around - снаружи кругом] the door began howling “come-all-ye’s” and continued to howl them. The room grew noisy  [room grew noisy - комната стала шумной] and reeking. Quarrels started  [quarrels started - начались ссоры] up here and there. Bad language  [bad language - сквернословие] and obscene songs  [obscene songs - нецензурные песни] were heard. The girls, swung rudely  [swung rudely - грубо замахнулись] in the dances, became dishevelled  [became dishevelled - растрепался] and tawdry. Valancy, alone in her corner, was feeling disgusted  [feeling disgusted - чувство отвращения] and repentant. Why had she ever come  [ever come - когда-нибудь придет] to such a place? Freedom and independence were all very well, but one should not be a little fool. [little fool - маленький дурак]  She might have known what it would be like—she might have taken warning  [taken warning - предупредили] from Cissy’s guarded sentences. [guarded sentences - осторожные приговоры]  Her head was aching—she was sick of the whole thing. [whole thing - все дело]  But what could she do? She must stay  [must stay - надо остаться] to the end. Abel could  [abel could - авель мог] not leave till  [leave till - оставить до] then. And that would probably  [would probably - скорее всего] be not till three  [till three - до трех] or four in the morning.

It was at this moment that she saw Barney Snaith looking in over the heads of the crowd at the doorway. Valancy had two distinct convictions—one was that she was quite safe  [quite safe - вполне безопасно] now; the other was that _this_ was why she had wanted to come to the dance. It had been such an absurd hope  [absurd hope - абсурдная надежда] that she had not recognised it before, but now she knew she had come because of the possibility that Barney might  [barney might - барни может] be there, too. She thought that perhaps she ought to be ashamed for this, but she wasn’t. After her feeling of relief her next feeling  [next feeling - следующее чувство] was one of annoyance with Barney for coming there unshaved. Surely he might have enough self- [enough self - достаточно себя] respect to groom himself up decently when he went to a party. There he was, bareheaded, bristly-chinned, in his old trousers  [old trousers - старые штаны] and his blue homespun shirt. [blue homespun shirt - синяя домотканая рубашка]  Not even a coat. Valancy could  [valancy could - валенси мог] have shaken him in her anger. No wonder people believed everything bad of him.

But she was not afraid any longer. One of the whispering group left  [whispering group left - шепчущая группа ушла] his comrades and came across  [came across - наткнулся] the room to her, through the whirling couples  [whirling couples - кружащиеся пары ] that now filled it uncomfortably. He was a tall, broad-shouldered fellow, [shouldered fellow - плечистый парень]  not ill-dressed or ill-looking but unmistakably half drunk. [unmistakably half drunk - безошибочно полупьяный]  He asked Valancy  [asked valancy - спросила валэнси] to dance. Valancy declined civilly. [valancy declined civilly - валэнси вежливо отказался]  His face turned livid. [face turned livid - лицо побагровело]  He threw his arm about her and pulled her to him. His hot, whiskied breath burned  [whiskied breath burned - виски сожгло дыхание] her face.

“We won’t have fine-lady airs  [lady airs - леди делает вид] here, my girl. If you ain’t too good to come here you ain’t too good to dance with us. Me and my pals have been watching you. You’ve got to give us  [give us - дай нам] each a turn and a kiss to boot.”

Valancy tried desperately  [valancy tried desperately - валенси отчаянно пытался] and vainly to free herself. She was being dragged out into the maze of shouting, stamping, yelling dancers. [yelling dancers - кричащие танцоры]  The next moment  [next moment - в следующий момент] the man who held her went staggering across  [went staggering across - пошатнулся] the room from a neatly planted blow  [neatly planted blow - аккуратно нанесенный удар] on the jaw, knocking down whirling couples  [whirling couples - кружащиеся пары] as he went. Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валанси чувствовал] her arm grasped. [arm grasped - схватил за руку] 

“This way—quick,” said Barney Snaith. He swung her out through the open window behind  [open window behind - открытое окно сзади] them, vaulted lightly  [vaulted lightly - легко перепрыгнул] over the sill and caught her hand.

“Quick—we must run  [must run - должен бежать] for it—they’ll be after us.”

Valancy ran  [valancy ran - валэнси бежал] as she had never run  [never run - никогда не бежал] before, clinging tight  [clinging tight - цепляюсь крепко] to Barney’s hand, wondering why she did not drop dead  [drop dead - офигительно] in such a mad scamper. [mad scamper - безумный бегун]  Suppose she did! What a scandal it would make  [would make -  заставит] for her poor people. [poor people - бедные люди]  For the first time Valancy felt a little sorry  [little sorry - немного жаль] for them. Also, she felt glad  [felt glad - радовался] that she had escaped from that horrible row. [horrible row - ужасная ссора]  Also, glad that she was holding tight  [holding tight - держится крепко] to Barney’s hand. Her feelings were badly mixed  [badly mixed - плохая смесь] and she had never had so many in such a brief time  [brief time - короткое время] in her life.

They finally reached  [finally reached - наконец-то достиг] a quiet corner  [quiet corner - тихий уголок] in the pine woods. [pine woods - сосна леса]  The pursuit had taken a different direction  [different direction - другое направление] and the whoops and yells behind  [yells behind - кричит позади] them were growing faint. [growing faint - слабеет]  Valancy, out of breath, with a crazily beating heart, [crazily beating heart - безумно бьющееся сердце]  collapsed on the trunk of a fallen pine. [fallen pine - упавшая сосна] 

“Thanks,” she gasped.

“What a goose you were to come to such a place!” said Barney.

“I—didn’t—know—it—would—be like this,” protested Valancy. [,” protested valancy - », — запротестовала вэлэнси] 

“You _should_ have known. Chidley Corners!”

“It—was—just—a name—to me.”

Valancy knew Barney could not realise how ignorant she was of the regions “u [regions “ - регионы «] p back.” She had lived in Deerwood all her life and of course he supposed she knew. He didn’t know how she had been brought up. There was no use trying  [use trying - используйте попытки] to explain.

“When I drifted in at Abel’s this evening and Cissy told  [cissy told - скромно сказала] me you’d come here I was amazed. And downright scared. [downright scared - совершенно испуганный]  Cissy told me she was worried about you but hadn’t liked to say anything  [say anything - скажите что-нибудь] to dissuade you for fear you’d think she was thinking selfishly  [thinking selfishly - думая эгоистично] about herself. So I came on up here instead of going to Deerwood.”

Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валэнси войлок] a sudden delightful glow irradiating soul and body under the dark pines. [dark pines - темные сосны]  So he had actually come  [actually come - на самом деле пришли] up to look after her.

“As soon as they stop hunting  [stop hunting -  прекратите охотиться] for us we’ll sneak around  [sneak around - красться] to the Muskoka road. [muskoka road - мускока-роуд]  I left Lady Jane  [left lady jane - ушла леди джейн] down there. I’ll take you home. I suppose you’ve had enough of your party.”

“Quite,” said Valancy meekly. The first half  [first half - барни снейт] of the way home neither  [way home neither - путь домой ни то, ни другое] of them said anything. [said anything - известная тюрьма]  It would not have been much use. [much use - много шума]  Lady Jane made  [lady jane made - леди джейн не заставила себя чувствовать склонность к разговору] so much noise  [much noise - губы дернулись] they could not have heard each other. Anyway, Valancy did not feel conversationally inclined. [feel conversationally inclined - что-нибудь сказала]  She was ashamed of the whole affair—ashamed of her folly in going—ashamed of being found in such a place by Barney Snaith. [barney snaith - высокие коровяки стояли]  By Barney Snaith, reputed jail- [reputed jail - много пользы] breaker, infidel, forger and defaulter. Valancy’s lips twitched  [lips twitched - первая половина] in the darkness as she thought of it. But she _was_ ashamed.

And yet she was enjoying herself—was full of a strange exultation—bumping over that rough road beside Barney Snaith. The big trees shot  [big trees shot - чувствую что угодно, кроме] by them. The tall mulleins stood  [tall mulleins stood - настроение быстро поднялось] up along the road in stiff, orderly ranks like companies of soldiers. The thistles looked like drunken fairies or tipsy elves  [tipsy elves - свет пронесся] as their car-lights passed  [lights passed - наименее испуганный] over them. This was the first time  [first time - сосновый лес обветшал] she had even been in a car. After all, she liked it. She was not in the least afraid, [least afraid - первый раз]  with Barney at the wheel. Her spirits rose rapidly  [spirits rose rapidly -  комета мчится славно] as they tore along. [tore along - подвыпившие эльфы]  She ceased to feel ashamed. [feel ashamed - мчаться вперед]  She ceased to feel anything except  [feel anything except - чувствую стыд] that she was part of a comet rushing gloriously  [comet rushing gloriously - большие деревья прострелены] through the night of space.

All at once, just where the pine woods frayed  [pine woods frayed - леди джейн замедлила движение] out to the scrub barrens, [scrub barrens - пришел извиняющимся тоном назад]  Lady Jane became quiet—too quiet. Lady Jane slowed  [lady jane slowed - пустоши пустыни] down quietly—and stopped.

Barney uttered  [barney uttered - ошарашенное восклицание ] an aghast exclamation. [aghast exclamation - уехал из дома]  Got out. Investigated. Came apologetically back. [came apologetically back - барни произнес] 

“I’m a doddering idiot. [doddering idiot - в девяти милях отсюда]  Out of gas. I knew I was short when I left home, [left home - брехливый идиот]  but I meant to fill up in Deerwood. Then I forgot all about it in my hurry to get to the Corners.”

“What can we do?” asked Valancy coolly.

“I don’t know. There’s no gas nearer  [gas nearer - смело уезжай] than Deerwood, nine miles away. [nine miles away - сумасшедшие дураки вернулись]  And I don’t dare leave  [dare leave - лучше всего] you here alone. There are always tramps  [always tramps - короткий смех] on this road—and some of those crazy fools back  [crazy fools back - машина подъезжает] at the Corners may come straggling along presently. There were boys there from the Port. As far as I can see, the best thing  [best thing - всегда бродяги] to do is for us just to sit patiently  [sit patiently - газ ближе] here until some car comes along  [car comes along - сиди терпеливо] and lends us enough gas to get to Roaring Abel’s with.”

“Well, what’s the matter with that?” said Valancy.

“We may have to sit here all night,” said Barney.

“I don’t mind,” said Valancy.

Barney gave  [barney gave - глава xxi] a short laugh. [short laugh - барни дал]  “If you don’t, I needn’t. I haven’t any reputation to lose.”

“Nor I,” said Valancy comfortably.



 CHAPTER XXI [chapter xxi - , – сказал барни] 

 “We’ll just sit here,” said Barney, [,” said barney - все, что стоит ]  “and if we think of anything worth  [anything worth - пустая трата времени] while saying we’ll say it. Otherwise, not. Don’t imagine you’re bound to talk to me.”

“John Foster says,” quoted Valancy, “‘If you can sit in silence with a person for half an hour and yet be entirely comfortable, [entirely comfortable - , – признал барни]  you and that person can be friends. If you cannot, friends you’ll never be and you need not waste time  [waste time - совершенно комфортно] in trying.’”

“Evidently John Foster says a sensible thing  [sensible thing - тканое кружево теней] once in a while,” conceded Barney. [,” conceded barney - разумная вещь] 

They sat in silence for a long while. Little rabbits hopped across the road. Once or twice an owl laughed  [owl laughed - остров должен] out delightfully. The road beyond  [road beyond - сова смеялась] them was fringed with the woven shadow lace  [woven shadow lace - дорога за ним] of trees. Away off to the southwest the sky was full of silvery little cirrus clouds above the spot where Barney’s island must  [island must - вещи рассветают] be.

Valancy was perfectly happy. [perfectly happy - вспышки молнии]  Some things dawn  [things dawn - все приходит] on you slowly. Some things come  [things come - совершенно счастлив] by lightning flashe [lightning flash - знал очень хорошо] s. [lightning flashes - вспышка молнии]  Valancy had had a lightning flash.

She knew quite well  [knew quite well - думал отдельно] now that she loved Barney. [loved barney - даже смотрел]  Yesterday she had been all her own. Now she was this man’s. Yet he had done nothing—said nothing. He had not even looked  [even looked - все стало новым] at her as a woman. But that didn’t matter. Nor did it matter what he was or what he had done. She loved him without any reservations. Everything in her went out wholly to him. She had no wish to stifle or disown her love. She seemed to be his so absolutely that thought apart  [thought apart -  любил барни] from him—thought in which he did not predominate—was an impossibility.

She was no longer unimportant, [longer unimportant - более неважная]  little, old maid Valancy Stirling. She was a woman, full of love and therefore rich  [therefore rich - поэтому богатая] and significant—justified to herself. Life was no longer empty  [longer empty - более пустая] and futile, and death could cheat  [death could cheat - смерть может обмануть] her of nothing. Love had cast out her last fear. [last fear - последний страх] 

Love! What a searing, torturing, intolerably sweet thing  [intolerably sweet thing - невыносимо сладкая вещь] it was—this possession of body, soul and mind! With something at its core as fine and remote and purely spiritual  [purely spiritual - чисто духовная] as the tiny blue spark  [tiny blue spark - крошечная голубая искорка] in the heart of the unbreakable diamond. [unbreakable diamond - нерушимый алмаз]  No dream had ever been like this. She was no longer solitary. [longer solitary - долго одинокая]  She was one of a vast sisterhood—all the women who had ever loved  [ever loved - всегда любимая] in the world.

Barney need never know it—though she would not in the least have minded his knowing. But _she_ knew it and it made a tremendous difference  [tremendous difference - огромная разница ] to her. Just to love! She did not ask to be loved. It was rapture enough  [rapture enough - достаточно восторга] just to sit there beside him in silence, alone in the summer night  [summer night - летняя ночь] in the white splendour  [white splendour - белое великолепие] of moonshine, with the wind blowing  [wind blowing - веет ветер] down on them out of the pine woods. [pine woods - сосновый лес]  She had always envied  [always envied - всегда позавидую] the wind. So free. Blowing where it listed. Through the hills. Over the lakes. What a tang, what a zip it had! What a magic of adventure! Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валентность войлок] as if she had exchanged her shop-worn soul  [worn soul - изношенная душа] for a fresh one, [fresh one - свежее]  fire-new from the workshop of the gods. As far back  [far back - далеко] as she could look, [could look - могу выглядеть]  life had been dull—colourless—savourless. Now she had come to a little patch  [little patch - маленькое пятнышко] of violets, purple and fragrant—hers for the plucking. No matter who or what had been in Barney’s past—no matter who or what might be in his future—no one else could ever have this perfect hour. [perfect hour - идеальный час]  She surrendered herself utterly to the charm of the moment.

“Ever dream of ballooning?” said Barney suddenly.

“No,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - », сказала Валенси] 

“I do—often. Dream of sailing through the clouds—seeing the glories of sunset—spending hours in the midst of a terrific storm  [terrific storm - потрясающий шторм] with lightning playing  [lightning playing - игра молнии] above and below you—skimming above a silver cloud floor  [silver cloud floor - серебристое облачное дно] under a full moon—wonderful!”

“It does sound so,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - », сказала Валенси]  “I’ve stayed on earth in my dreams.”

She told him about her Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  It was so easy to tell Barney things. [tell barney things - скажи Барни вещи]  One felt  [one felt - один чувствовал] he understood everything—even the things you didn’t tell him. And then she told him a little of her existence before she came to Roaring Abel’s. She wanted him to see why she had gone to the dance “u [dance “ - танец «] p back.”

“You see—I’ve never had any real life,” she said. “I’ve just—breathed. Every door  [every door - каждая дверь] has always been shut to me.”

“But you’re still young,” said Barney.

“Oh, I know. Yes, I’m ‘still young’—but that’s so different from _young_,” said Valancy bitterly. For a moment she was tempted to tell Barney  [tell barney - скажи барни] why her years had nothing to do with her future; but she did not. She was not going to think of death tonight. [death tonight - смерть сегодня вечером] 

“Though I never was really young,” she went on—“until tonight,” she added in her heart. “I never had a life like  [life like - жизнь как] other girls. You couldn’t understand. Why,”—she had a desperate desire  [desperate desire - отчаянное желание] that Barney should know the worst about her—“I didn’t even love  [even love - даже любовь] my mother. Isn’t it awful that I don’t love my mother?”

“Rather awful—for her,” said Barney drily.

“Oh, she didn’t know it. She took my love for granted. And I wasn’t any use or comfort to her or anybody. I was just a—a—vegetable. And I got tired  [got tired - устал] of it. That’s why I came to keep house  [keep house - вести дом] for Mr. Gay and look after Cissy.”

“And I suppose your people thought  [people thought - люди думали] you’d gone mad.”

“They did—and do—literally,” said Valancy. “But it’s a comfort to them. They’d rather believe  [rather believe - скорее верят] me mad than bad. There’s no other alternative. But I’ve been _living_ since I came to Mr. Gay’s. It’s been a delightful experience. [delightful experience - восхитительный опыт]  I suppose I’ll pay for it when I have to go back—but I’ll have _had_ it.”

“That’s true,” said Barney. “If you buy your experience it’s your own. So it’s no matter how much you pay for it. Somebody else’s experience can never be yours. Well, it’s a funny old world.”

“Do you think it really is old?” asked Valancy dreamily. “I never believe _that_ in June. It seems so young tonight—somehow. In that quivering moonlight—like a young, white girl—waiting.”

“Moonlight here on the verge of up back is different from moonlight anywhere else,” agreed Barney. “It always makes  [always makes - всегда заставляет] me feel so clean, somehow—body and soul. And of course the age of gold always comes back in spring.”

It was ten o’clock now. A dragon of black cloud ate  [black cloud ate - черное облако съело ] up the moon. The spring air grew chill—Valancy shivered. Barney reached back  [barney reached back - барни потянулся назад] into the innards of Lady Jane  [lady jane - леди джейн] and clawed up an old, tobacco-scented overcoat. [scented overcoat - ароматное пальто] 

“Put that on,” he ordered.

“Don’t you want it yourself?” protested Valancy.

“No. I’m not going to have you catching cold  [catching cold - простужаюсь] on my hands.”

“Oh, I won’t catch cold. [catch cold - простудился]  I haven’t had a cold since  [cold since - простужен с тех пор] I came to Mr. Gay’s—though I’ve done the foolishest things. [foolishest things - самые глупые вещи]  It’s funny, too—I used to have them all the time. I feel so selfish taking  [selfish taking - эгоистично беру] your coat.”

“You’ve sneezed three times. [sneezed three times - чихнул три раза]  No use winding  [use winding - использовать намотку] up your ‘experience’ up back with grippe or pneumonia.”

He pulled it up tight about her throat and buttoned it on her. Valancy submitted  [valancy submitted - валанс представлен] with secret delight. [secret delight - тайное наслаждение]  How nice it was to have some one look  [one look - один взгляд] after you so! She snuggled down into the tobaccoey folds  [tobaccoey folds - табачные складки] and wished the night could last forever.

Ten minutes later  [ten minutes later - десять минут спустя] a car swooped  [car swooped - машина спикировала] down on them from “up back.” Barney sprang from Lady Jane  [lady jane - леди джейн] and waved his hand. The car came  [car came - машина приехала] to a stop beside  [stop beside - стоп рядом] them. Valancy saw Uncle Wellington and Olive gazing  [olive gazing - смотрит на оливу] at her in horror from it.

So Uncle Wellington  [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон] had got a car! And he must have been spending the evening up at Mistawis with Cousin Herbert. [cousin herbert - двоюродный брат герберт]  Valancy almost laughed aloud at the expression on his face as he recognised her. The pompous, bewhiskered old humbug! [bewhiskered old humbug - старый мошенник с бакенбардами] 

“Can you let me have enough gas  [enough gas - достаточно бензина] to take me to Deerwood?” Barney was asking politely. [asking politely - вежливо спросила]  But Uncle Wellington  [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон] was not attending to him.

“Valancy, how came you _here_!” he said sternly. [said sternly - сурово сказала] 

“By chance or God’s grace,” said Valancy.

“With this jail-bird—at ten o’clock at night!” said Uncle Wellington.

Valancy turned  [valancy turned - валенси повернулась] to Barney. The moon had escaped from its dragon and in its light her eyes were full of deviltry.

“_Are_ you a jail-bird?”

“Does it matter?” said Barney, gleams of fun in _his_ eyes.

“Not to me. I only asked out of curiosity,” continued Valancy.

“Then I won’t tell you. I never satisfy curiosity.” He turned to Uncle Wellington  [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон] and his voice changed subtly. [voice changed subtly - голос слегка изменился] 

“Mr. Stirling, I asked you if you could let  [could let - могу позволить] me have some gas. If you can, well and good. If not, we are only delaying you unnecessarily.”

Uncle Wellington  [uncle wellington - дядя Веллингтон] was in a horrible dilemma. [horrible dilemma - ужасная дилемма]  To give gas  [give gas - дай газ] to this shameless pair! [shameless pair - бессовестная парочка]  But not to give it to them! To go away  [go away - уходи] and leave them there in the Mistawis woods—until daylight, likely. It was better to give it to them and let them get out of sight before any one else saw  [one else saw - один еще видел] them.

“Got anything to get gas  [get gas - заправиться] in?” he grunted surlily. [grunted surlily - угрюмо хрюкнул] 

Barney produced  [barney produced - барни произвел] a two-gallon measure  [gallon measure - мера галлона] from Lady Jane. [lady jane - леди джейн]  The two men went  [two men went - двое мужчин поехали] to the rear of the Stirling car  [stirling car - машина стирлинга] and began manipulating  [began manipulating - начал манипулировать] the tap. Valancy stole sly glances at Olive over the collar of Barney’s coat. Olive was sitting grimly staring straight ahead with an outraged expression. [outraged expression - возмущенное выражение лица]  She did not mean to take any notice of Valancy. Olive had her own secret reasons  [secret reasons - тайные причины] for feeling outraged. [feeling outraged - чувство возмущения]  Cecil had been in Deerwood lately  [deerwood lately - дирвуд в последнее время] and of course had heard all about Valancy. He agreed that her mind was deranged and was exceedingly anxious  [exceedingly anxious - чрезвычайно встревоженный] to find out whence the derangement had been inherited. It was a serious thing  [serious thing - серьезная вещь] to have in the family—a very serious thing. One had to think of one’s—descendants.

“She got it from the Wansbarras,” said Olive positively. “There’s nothing like  [nothing like - ничего похожего] that in the Stirlings—nothing!”

“I hope not—I certainly hope  [certainly hope - конечно надеюсь] not,” Cecil  [,” cecil - », сесил] had responded dubiously. [responded dubiously - ответил сомнительно]  “But then—to go out as a servant—for that is what it practically amounts  [practically amounts - практически количество] to. Your cousin!”

Poor Olive felt  [poor olive felt - бедный оливковый войлок] the implication. The Port Lawrence Prices  [port lawrence prices - порт-лоуренс цены] were not accustomed to ally themselves with families whose members “worked out.”

Valancy could  [valancy could - валэнси мог] not resist temptation. [resist temptation - устоять перед искушением]  She leaned forward. [leaned forward - наклонился вперед] 

“Olive, does it hurt?”

Olive bit—stiffly.

“Does _what_ hurt?”

“Looking like that.”

For a moment Olive resolved  [moment olive resolved - момент, когда оливковое решилось] she would take  [would take - возьмет] no further notice of Valancy. Then duty came uppermost. [duty came uppermost - долг пришел самая верхняя]  She must not miss the opportunity.

“Doss,” she implored, leaning forward also, [leaning forward also - тоже наклонилась вперед]  “won’t you come home—come home tonight?”

Valancy yawned. [valancy yawned - валэнси зевнула] 

“You sound like  [sound like - похоже на] a revival meeting,” she said. “You really do.”

“If you will come back——”

“All will be forgiven.”

“Yes,” said Olive eagerly. Wouldn’t it be splendid if _she_ could induce the prodigal daughter  [prodigal daughter - блудная дочь] to return? “We’ll never cast  [never cast - никогда не бросает] it up to you. Doss, there are nights when I cannot sleep  [cannot sleep - не может спать] for thinking of you.”

“And me having the time of my life,” said Valancy, laughing.

“Doss, I can’t believe you’re bad. I’ve always said  [always said - всегда говорила] you couldn’t be bad——”

“I don’t believe I can be,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , – сказала вэлэнси]  “I’m afraid I’m hopelessly proper. [hopelessly proper - безнадежно правильно]  I’ve been sitting here for three hours  [three hours - три часа] with Barney Snaith  [barney snaith - барни снайт] and he hasn’t even tried  [even tried - даже пробовала] to kiss me. I wouldn’t have minded if he had, Olive.”

“Thanks—that’s enough,” said Barney behind the car. “Much obliged, Mr. Stirling. Two gallons—seventy cents. Thank you.”

Uncle Wellington climbed foolishly and feebly into his car. He wanted to give Snaith  [give snaith - дай снайт] a piece of his mind, but dared not. Who knew what the creature might  [creature might - существо может] do if provoked? No doubt he carried firearms. [carried firearms - нести огнестрельное оружие] 

Uncle Wellington looked indecisively at Valancy. But Valancy had turned her back on him and was watching Barney pour  [watching barney pour - наблюдать за барни, наливая] the gas into Lady Jane’s maw.

“Drive on,” said Olive decisively. “There’s no use in waiting here. Let me tell you what she said to me.”

“The little hussy! [little hussy - маленькая шлюха]  The shameless little hussy!” said Uncle Wellington.



 CHAPTER XXII [chapter xxii - глава xxii] 

 The next thing  [next thing - следующее] the Stirlings heard  [stirlings heard - стирлингс слышал] was that Valancy had been seen with Barney Snaith  [barney snaith - барни снайт] in a movie theatre  [movie theatre - кинотеатр] in Port Lawrence  [port lawrence - порт лоуренс] and after it at supper in a Chinese restaurant  [chinese restaurant - китайский ресторан] there. This was quite true—and no one was more surprised at it than Valancy herself. Barney had come along  [come along - приходите] in Lady Jane one dim twilight and told Valancy unceremoniously  [told valancy unceremoniously - бесцеремонно сказал Валенси] if she wanted a drive to hop in.

“I’m going to the Port. Will you go there with me?”

His eyes were teasing and there was a bit of defiance in his voice. Valancy, who did not conceal from herself that she would have gone anywhere  [gone anywhere - ушла куда угодно] with him to any place, “hopped in” without  [” without - ” без] more ado. They tore into and through Deerwood. Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles, [cousin stickles - двоюродные палочки]  taking a little air  [little air - мало воздуха] on the verandah, saw them whirl by in a cloud of dust and sought comfort  [sought comfort - искала утешения] in each other’s eyes. Valancy, who in some dim pre- [dim pre - тусклое пред] existence had been afraid of a car, was hatless and her hair was blowing wildly round  [blowing wildly round - дико дует круглые] her face. She would certainly come  [would certainly come - обязательно придет] down with bronchitis—and die at Roaring Abel’s. She wore a low-necked dress  [necked dress - платье с шеей] and her arms were bare. That Snaith creature  [snaith creature - снаитское существо] was in his shirt-sleeves, smoking a pipe. They were going at the rate of forty miles  [forty miles - сорок миль] an hour—sixty, Cousin Stickles averred. [cousin stickles averred - двоюродные палочки подтверждены]  Lady Jane could hit the pike when she wanted to. Valancy waved  [valancy waved - валентность махнула] her hand gaily  [hand gaily - рука весело] to her relatives. As for Mrs. Frederick, she was wishing she knew how to go into hysterics.

“Was it for this,” she demanded in hollow tones, [hollow tones - пустые тона]  “that I suffered the pangs of motherhood?”

“I will not believe,” said Cousin Stickles solemnly, “that our prayers will not yet be answered.”

“Who—_who_ will protect that unfortunate girl  [unfortunate girl - несчастная девушка] when I am gone?” moaned Mrs. Frederick.

As for Valancy, she was wondering if it could really  [could really - могу действительно] be only a few weeks since  [weeks since - недели с тех пор] she had sat there with them on that verandah. Hating the rubber-plant. Pestered with teasing questions like black flies. Always thinking  [always thinking - всегда думать] of appearances. Cowed because of Aunt Wellington’s teaspoons and Uncle Benjamin’s money. Poverty-stricken. Afraid of everybody. Envying Olive. [envying olive - завидую маслине]  A slave to moth-eaten traditions. [eaten traditions - съеденные традиции]  Nothing to hope for or expect.

And now every day  [every day - каждый день] was a gay adventure. [gay adventure -  веселые приключения] 

Lady Jane flew  [lady jane flew - леди джейн летала] over the fifteen miles  [fifteen miles - пятнадцать миль] between Deerwood and the Port—through the Port. The way Barney went past traffic policemen was not holy. The lights were beginning to twinkle out like stars  [like stars - как звезды] in the clear, lemon-hued twilight air. [hued twilight air - окрашенный сумеречный воздух]  This was the only time Valancy ever really liked the town, and she was crazy with the delight of speeding. Was it possible she had ever been afraid of a car? She was perfectly happy, [perfectly happy - совершенно счастливый]  riding beside Barney. [riding beside barney - кататься рядом с барни]  Not that she deluded herself into thinking it had any significance. She knew quite well  [knew quite well - довольно хорошо знала] that Barney had asked her to go on the impulse of the moment—an impulse born  [impulse born - рожденный импульсом] of a feeling of pity for her and her starved little dreams. [starved little dreams - голодные маленькие сны]  She was looking tired  [looking tired - выглядит усталым] after a wakeful night  [wakeful night - бессонная ночь] with a heart attack, [heart attack - сердечный приступ ]  followed by a busy day. [busy day - напряженный день]  She had so little fun. [little fun - немного веселья]  He’d give her an outing for once. Besides, Abel was in the kitchen, at the point of drunkenness where he was declaring he did not believe in God and beginning to sing ribald songs. [sing ribald songs - петь непристойные песни]  It was just as well she should be out of the way for a while. Barney knew Roaring Abel’s repertoire.

They went to the movie—Valancy had never been to a movie. And then, finding a nice hunger upon  [nice hunger upon - приятный голод] them, they went and had fried chicken—unbelievably delicious—in the Chinese restaurant. [chinese restaurant - китайский ресторан]  After which they rattled home  [rattled home - разгромленный дом] again, leaving a devastating trail  [devastating trail - разрушительный след] of scandal behind  [scandal behind - скандал позади] them. Mrs. Frederick gave  [frederick gave - фредерик дал] up going to church altogether. [church altogether - церковь в целом]  She could not endure her friends’ pitying glances and questions. But Cousin Stickles went every Sunday. She said they had been given a cross to bear.



 CHAPTER XXIII [chapter xxiii - глава xxiii] 

 On one of Cissy’s wakeful nights, [wakeful nights - бессонные ночи]  she told Valancy  [told valancy - сказанная валентность] her poor little story. [poor little story - бедная маленькая история]  They were sitting by the open window. [open window - открытое окно]  Cissy could  [cissy could - Цисси могла] not get her breath lying  [breath lying - дышать лежать] down that night. An inglorious gibbous moon  [inglorious gibbous moon - бесславная горбатая луна] was hanging over the wooded hills  [wooded hills - лесистые холмы] and in its spectral light Cissy looked frail and lovely and incredibly young. [incredibly young - невероятно молода]  A child. It did not seem possible  [seem possible - кажется возможно] that she could have lived through all the passion and pain and shame of her story.

“He was stopping at the hotel across  [hotel across - отель напротив] the lake. He used to come over in his canoe at night—we met in the pines down the shore. He was a young college student—his father was a rich man  [rich man - за богатого человека] in Toronto. Oh, Valancy, I didn’t mean to be bad—I didn’t, indeed. But I loved him so—I love him yet—I’ll always love  [always love - всегда любовь] him. And I—didn’t know—some things. I didn’t—understand. Then his father came  [father came - приходил отец] and took him away. And—after a little—I found out—oh, Valancy,—I was so frightened. I didn’t know what to do. I wrote him—and he came. He—he said he would marry  [would marry - вышла бы замуж] me, Valancy.”

“And why—and why?——”

“Oh, Valancy, he didn’t love me any more. I saw that at a glance. He—he was just offering to marry me because he thought he ought to—because he was sorry for me. He wasn’t bad—but he was so young—and what was I that he should keep on loving me?”

“Never mind making excuses for him,” said Valancy  [,” said valancy - , – сказала Валенси] a bit shortly. [bit shortly - немного короче]  “So you wouldn’t marry him?”

“I couldn’t—not when he didn’t love me any more. Somehow—I can’t explain—it seemed a worse thing  [worse thing - хуже того] to do than—the other. He—he argued a little—but he went away. [went away - ушла]  Do you think I did right, Valancy?”

“Yes, I do. _You_ did right. But he——”

“Don’t blame him, dear. Please don’t. Let’s not talk about him at all. There’s no need. I wanted to tell you how it was—I didn’t want you to think me bad——”

“I never did think so.”

“Yes, I felt that—whenever you came. Oh, Valancy, what you’ve been to me! I can never tell  [never tell - никогда не говори] you—but God will bless you for it. I know He will—‘with what measure ye mete.’”

Cissy sobbed  [cissy sobbed - Цисси рыдала] for a few minutes in Valancy’s arms. Then she wiped her eyes.

“Well, that’s almost all. I came home. [came home - пришла домой]  I wasn’t really so very unhappy. I suppose I should have been—but I wasn’t. Father wasn’t hard on me. And my baby was so sweet while he lived. I was even happy—I loved him so much, the dear little thing. [dear little thing - милая малышка]  He was so sweet, Valancy—with such lovely blue eyes—and little rings  [little rings - кольца] of pale gold hair like silk floss—and tiny dimpled hands. [tiny dimpled hands - крошка ручки в ямочках]  I used to bite his satin-smooth little face  [smooth little face - гладкое личико] all over—softly, so as not to hurt him, you know——”

“I know,” said Valancy, wincing. “I know—a woman _always_ knows—and dreams——”

“And he was _all_ mine. Nobody else  [nobody else - никто больше] had any claim on him. When he died, oh, Valancy, I thought I must die  [must die - не должен умереть] too—I didn’t see how anybody could endure  [anybody could endure - каждый может вынести] such anguish and live. To see his dear little eyes  [dear little eyes - дорогие глазки] and know he would never open  [would never open - никогда не откроется] them again—to miss his warm little body nestled against mine at night and think of him sleeping alone  [sleeping alone - спать в одиночестве] and cold, his wee face  [wee face - крошечное личико] under the hard frozen earth. [hard frozen earth - твердая мерзлая земля]  It was so awful for the first year—after that it was a little easier, [little easier - немного легче]  one didn’t keep thinking ‘t [keep thinking ‘ - продолжаю думать '] his day last year’—but I was so glad when I found out I was dying.”

“‘Who could endure life  [could endure life - смогла вынести жизнь] if it were not for the hope of death?’” murmured Valancy softly—it was of course a quotation from some book of John Foster’s.

“I’m glad I’ve told you all about it,” sighed Cissy. [,” sighed cissy - », вздохнула сисси]  “I wanted you to know.”

Cissy died  [cissy died - цисси умерла] a few nights after that. Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] was away. When Valancy saw  [valancy saw - валенси пила] the change that had come over Cissy’s face she wanted to telephone for the doctor. But Cissy wouldn’t let her.

“Valancy, why should you? He can do nothing for me. I’ve known for several days  [several days - несколько дней] that—this—was near. Let me die in peace, dear—just holding your hand. Oh, I’m so glad you’re here. Tell Father good- [tell father good - скажи отцу хорошо] bye for me. He’s always been as good to me as he knew how—and Barney. Somehow, I think that Barney——”

But a spasm of coughing interrupted  [coughing interrupted -  кашель прервался] and exhausted her. She fell asleep  [fell asleep - заснула] when it was over, still holding  [still holding - все еще держала] to Valancy’s hand. Valancy sat  [valancy sat - валенси сидела] there in the silence. She was not frightened—or even sorry. [even sorry - даже жаль]  At sunrise Cissy died. [sunrise cissy died - восход солнца сисси умерла]  She opened her eyes and looked past Valancy  [looked past valancy - посмотрела мимо вэлэнси] at something—something that made her smile suddenly  [smile suddenly - улыбнулась вдруг] and happily. And, smiling, she died.

Valancy crossed Cissy’s hands on her breast and went to the open window. [open window - открытое окно]  In the eastern sky, [eastern sky - восточное небо]  amid the fires of sunrise, an old moon  [old moon - старая луна] was hanging—as slender and lovely as a new moon. [new moon - новая луна]  Valancy had never seen  [never seen - никогда не виделась] an old, old moon before. She watched it pale and fade until it paled and faded out of sight in the living rose  [living rose - живая роза] of day. A little pool  [little pool - маленький бассейн] in the barrens shone  [barrens shone - засияли пустоши] in the sunrise like  [sunrise like - как восход солнца] a great golden lily. [great golden lily - великая золотая лилия] 

“Cissy dead—Cissy dead,” he said vacantly. [said vacantly - сказала рассеянно]  “I didn’t think it would ‘a [would ‘ - была бы '] ’ come  [’ come - ' пришла] so soon. Dead. She used to run down the lane to meet me with a little white rose stuck in her hair. Cissy used  [cissy used - сисси использовала] to be a pretty little girl. [pretty little girl - хорошенькая девочка]  And a good little girl.”

“She has always been a good little girl,” said Valancy.



 CHAPTER XXIV [chapter xxiv - глава xxiv] 

 Valancy herself made Cissy ready  [made cissy ready - приготовила сисси] for burial. No hands but hers should touch that pitiful, wasted little body. [wasted little body - потраченное тельце]  The old house  [old house - старый дом] was spotless on the day of the funeral. Barney Snaith  [barney snaith - барни снайт] was not there. He had done all he could to help Valancy  [help valancy - помощь вэлэнси] before it—he had shrouded the pale Cecilia  [pale cecilia - бледная сесилия] in white roses  [white roses - белые розы] from the garden—and then had gone back  [gone back - уехал назад] to his island. But everybody else  [everybody else - все остальные] was there. All Deerwood and “up back” came. They forgave Cissy splendidly  [forgave cissy splendidly - простила сисси великолепно] at last. Mr. Bradly gave  [bradly gave - бессмысленно дали] a very beautiful funeral address. [beautiful funeral address - красивый похоронный адрес]  Valancy had wanted her old Free Methodist man, but Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] was obdurate. He was a Presbyterian and no one but a Presbyterian minister  [presbyterian minister - пресвитерианский министр] should bury _his_ daughter. Mr. Bradly was very tactful. He avoided all dubious points  [dubious points - сомнительные баллы] and it was plain to be seen he hoped for the best. Six reputable citizens  [six reputable citizens - шесть уважаемых граждан] of Deerwood bore Cecilia Gay to her grave in decorous Deerwood cemetery. [decorous deerwood cemetery - приличное кладбище в дирвуд]  Among them was Uncle Wellington. [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон] 

The Stirlings all came to the funeral, men and women. They had had a family conclave  [family conclave - семейный конклав] over it. Surely now that Cissy Gay  [cissy gay - сисси гей] was dead Valancy would come home. She simply could  [simply could - просто мог] not stay there with Roaring Abel. [roaring abel - ревущий авель]  That being the case, the wisest course—decreed Uncle James—was to attend the funeral—legitimise the whole thing, [whole thing - все дело]  so to speak—show Deerwood that Valancy had really done  [really done - действительно сделано] a most creditable deed  [creditable deed - похвальный поступок] in going to nurse poor Cecilia Gay and that her family backed  [family backed - поддерживаемый семьей] her up in it. Death, the miracle worker, [miracle worker - чудотворец]  suddenly made  [suddenly made - внезапно сделано] the thing quite respectable. [thing quite respectable - вещь весьма респектабельная]  If Valancy would return  [valancy would return - вэлэнси вернется] to home and decency while public opinion  [public opinion - общественное мнение] was under its influence all might yet  [might yet - еще может] be well. Society was suddenly forgetting  [suddenly forgetting -  внезапно забыв] all Cecilia’s wicked doings  [wicked doings - злые дела] and remembering what a pretty, modest little thing  [modest little thing - скромная штучка] she had been—“and motherless, you know—motherless!” It was the psychological moment—said Uncle James.

So the Stirlings went  [stirlings went - стирлинги ушли] to the funeral. Even Cousin Gladys’ neuritis allowed her to come. Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродные палочки] was there, her bonnet dripping  [bonnet dripping - капюшон капает] all over her face, crying as woefully as if Cissy had been her nearest and dearest. Funerals always brought Cousin Stickles’ “own sad bereavement” back.

And Uncle Wellington  [uncle wellington - дядя веллингтон] was a pall-bearer.

Valancy, pale, subdued-looking, her slanted eyes smudged  [slanted eyes smudged - раскосые глаза смазаны] with purple, in her snuff-brown dress, [brown dress - коричневое платье]  moving quietly  [moving quietly - тихо передвигаться] about, finding seats  [finding seats - найти места] for people, consulting in undertones with minister and undertaker, marshalling the “mourners” into the parlour, was so decorous and proper and Stirlingish that her family took heart  [family took heart - семья взяла на себя смелость] of grace. This was not—could not be—the girl who had sat all night in the woods with Barney Snaith—who had gone tearing bareheaded  [gone tearing bareheaded - ушел слезы с непокрытой головой] through Deerwood and Port Lawrence. [port lawrence - порт-лоуренс]  This was the Valancy they knew. Really, surprisingly capable  [surprisingly capable - удивительно способный] and efficient. Perhaps she had always been kept down a bit too much—Amelia really was rather strict—hadn’t had a chance to show what was in her. So thought the Stirlings. And Edward Beck, [edward beck - эдвард бек]  from the Port road, [port road - порт-роуд]  a widower with a large family  [large family - большая семья] who was beginning to take notice, [take notice - принять к сведению]  took notice  [took notice - приняла к сведению] of Valancy and thought she might make  [might make - может иметь] a mighty fine second wife. No beauty—but a fifty-year-old widower, [old widower - старый вдовец]  Mr. Beck told  [beck told - бек сказал] himself very reasonably, couldn’t expect everything. [expect everything - ожидать всего]  Altogether, it seemed that Valancy’s matrimonial chances  [matrimonial chances - матримониальные шансы] were never so bright as they were at Cecilia Gay’s funeral.

What the Stirlings and Edward Beck would  [edward beck would - эдвард бек бы] have thought had they known the back of Valancy’s mind must  [mind must - разум должен] be left to the imagination. Valancy was hating the funeral—hating the people who came to stare with curiosity at Cecilia’s marble-white face—hating the smugness—hating the dragging, melancholy singing—hating Mr. Bradly’s cautious platitudes. [cautious platitudes - осторожные банальности]  If she could have had her absurd way, [absurd way - абсурдным образом]  there would have been no funeral at all. She would have covered Cissy  [covered cissy - прикрыл сисси] over with flowers, shut her away from prying eyes, [prying eyes - любопытные глаза]  and buried her beside her nameless little baby  [nameless little baby - безымянный маленький ребенок] in the grassy burying- [grassy burying - травяное закапывание] ground under the pines of the “up back” church, with a bit of kindly prayer  [kindly prayer - добродушно помолиться] from the old Free Methodist minister. She remembered Cissy saying  [remembered cissy saying - вспомнил сисси поговорку] once, “I wish I could be buried deep  [buried deep - похоронен глубоко] in the heart of the woods where nobody would ever come to say, ‘Cissy Gay is buried here,’ and tell over my miserable story.”

But this! However, it would soon  [would soon - скоро] be over. Valancy knew, [valancy knew - валэнси знала]  if the Stirlings and Edward Beck  [edward beck - эдвард бек] didn’t, exactly what she intended to do then. She had lain awake  [lain awake - не спала ] all the preceding night thinking  [preceding night thinking - предшествующие ночные размышления] about it and finally deciding  [finally deciding - окончательно приняв решение] on it.

When the funeral procession  [funeral procession - похоронная процессия] had left the house, Mrs. Frederick sought  [frederick sought - фредерик искал] out Valancy in the kitchen.

“My child,” she said tremulously, [said tremulously - сказал дрожа]  “you’ll come home _now_?”

“Home,” said Valancy absently. She was getting on an apron and calculating how much tea  [much tea - много чая] she must put  [must put - надо поставить] to steep for supper. There would be several guests  [several guests - несколько гостей] from “up back”—distant relatives of the Gays’ who had not remembered them for years. And she was so tired she wished she could borrow  [could borrow - можно одолжить] a pair of legs from the cat.

“Yes, home,” said Mrs. Frederick, with a touch of asperity. “I suppose you won’t dream of staying here _now_—alone with Roaring Abel.”

“Oh, no, I’m not going to stay _here_,” said Valancy. “Of course, I’ll have to stay for a day or two, to put the house in order generally. [order generally - заказать вообще]  But that will be all. Excuse me, Mother, won’t you? I’ve a frightful lot  [frightful lot - ужасная участь] to do—all those “up back” people will be here to supper.”

Mrs. Frederick retreated  [frederick retreated - фредерик отступил] in considerable relief, [considerable relief - значительное облегчение]  and the Stirlings went home  [stirlings went home - стирлинги ушли домой] with lighter hearts. [lighter hearts - на сердце стало легче] 

“We will just treat her as if nothing had happened when she comes back,” decreed Uncle Benjamin. “That will be the best plan. [best plan - лучший план]  Just as if nothing had happened.”



 CHAPTER XXV [chapter xxv -  глава xxv] 

 On the evening of the day after the funeral Roaring Abel  [roaring abel - ревущий авель] went off for a spree. He had been sober for four whole days  [four whole days - четыре дня] and could endure  [could endure - могу вынести] it no longer. Before he went, Valancy told  [valancy told - валэнси сказала] him she would be going away  [going away - уезжать] the next day. [next day - следующий день]  Roaring Abel was sorry, and said so. A distant cousin  [distant cousin - дальний родственник] from “up back” was coming to keep house  [keep house - оставаться дома] for him—quite willing to do so now since there was no sick girl  [sick girl - больная девочка] to wait on—but Abel was not under any delusions concerning  [delusions concerning - заблуждения, касающиеся] her.

“She won’t be like you, my girl. Well, I’m obliged to you. You helped me out of a bad hole  [bad hole - плохая дыра] and I won’t forget it. And I won’t forget what you did for Cissy. I’m your friend, and if you ever want  [ever want - когда-либо хотел] any of the Stirlings spanked  [stirlings spanked - стирлингс отшлепал] and sot in a corner send  [corner send - угол отправить] for me. I’m going to wet my whistle. Lord, but I’m dry! Don’t reckon I’ll be back afore tomorrow night, so if you’re going home tomorrow, [going home tomorrow - идти домой завтра]  good-bye now.”

“I _may_ go home tomorrow,” said Valancy, “but I’m not going back  [going back -  возвращаюсь] to Deerwood.”

“Not going——”

“You’ll find the key on the woodshed nail,” interrupted Valancy, politely and unmistakably. “The dog will be in the barn and the cat in the cellar. Don’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes. [cousin comes - двоюродный брат приходит]  The pantry is full and I made bread  [made bread - испекла хлеб] and pies today. [pies today - пирожки сегодня]  Good-bye, Mr. Gay. You have been very kind to me and I appreciate it.”

“We’ve had a d——d decent time  [decent time - приличное время] of it together, and that’s a fact,” said Roaring Abel. “You’re the best small sport  [best small sport - лучший маленький спорт] in the world, and your little finger  [little finger - мизинец] is worth the whole Stirling clan tied together. Good-bye and good-luck.”

Valancy went  [valancy went - валэнси пошла] out to the garden. Her legs trembled  [legs trembled - ноги дрожали] a little, but otherwise she felt and looked composed. [looked composed - выглядел собранным]  She held something tightly  [held something tightly - держал что-то крепко] in her hand. The garden was lying in the magic of the warm, odorous July twilight. [odorous july twilight - пахучие июльские сумерки]  A few stars were out and the robins were calling through the velvety silences  [velvety silences - бархатное молчание] of the barrens. Valancy stood  [valancy stood - валенси стояла] by the gate expectantly. [gate expectantly - ворота выжидательно]  Would he come? If he did not——

He was coming. Valancy heard Lady Jane Grey far back in the woods. Her breath came  [breath came - выдохнулось ] a little more quickly. Nearer—and nearer—she could see Lady Jane now—bumping down the lane—nearer—nearer—he was there—he had sprung from the car and was leaning over the gate, looking at her.

“Going home, Miss Stirling?”

“I don’t know—yet,” said Valancy slowly. Her mind was made up, with no shadow of turning, but the moment was very tremendous.

“I thought I’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for you,” said Barney. [,” said barney - , — сказал барни] 

“Come, now! I knew luck  [knew luck - знал удачу] was just waiting around  [waiting around - ждать вокруг] the corner for me. All the signs have been pointing that way today.”

“Wait.” Valancy lifted her hand. “I’m in earnest—but I want to get my breath after that question. Of course, with my bringing up, I realise perfectly well  [realise perfectly well - прекрасно понимать] that this is one of the things ‘a [things ‘ - вещи ']  lady should not do.’”

“But why—why?”

“For two reasons.” Valancy was still a little breathless, [little breathless - немного затаив дыхание]  but she looked Barney straight  [looked barney straight - посмотрел на барни прямо] in the eyes, while all the dead Stirlings revolved rapidly in their graves and the living ones  [living ones - живые] did nothing because they did not know that Valancy was at that moment proposing lawful marriage to the notorious Barney Snaith. [notorious barney snaith - пресловутый барни снайт]  “The first reason  [first reason - первая причина] is, I—I”—Valancy tried to say “I [say “ - говорить «]  love you” but could not. She had to take refuge  [take refuge - найти убежище] in a pretended flippancy. [pretended flippancy - притворился легкомысленным]  “I’m crazy about you. The second is—this.”

She handed him Dr. Trent’s letter.

Barney opened  [barney opened - барни открыл] it with the air of a man thankful  [man thankful - человек благодарен] to find some safe, sane thing  [sane thing - нормальная вещь] to do. As he read it his face changed. [face changed - лицо изменилось ]  He understood—more perhaps than Valancy wanted  [valancy wanted - требуется валентность] him to.

“Are you sure nothing  [sure nothing - уверенно ничего] can be done for you?”

Valancy did not misunderstand the question.

“Yes. You know Dr. [know dr - знаю доктора]  Trent’s reputation in regard to heart disease. [heart disease - болезнь сердца]  I haven’t long to live—perhaps only a few months—a few weeks. I want to _live_ them. I can’t go back  [go back - вернись] to Deerwood—you know what my life was like there. And”—she managed it this time—“I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. That’s all.”

Barney folded  [barney folded - барни сложил] his arms on the gate and looked gravely enough  [looked gravely enough - выглядел достаточно серьезным] at a white, saucy star  [saucy star - дерзкая звезда] that was winking at him just over Roaring Abel’s kitchen chimney. [kitchen chimney - кухонный дымоход] 

“You don’t know anything  [know anything - знаю что-нибудь] about me. I may be a—murderer.”

“No, I don’t. You _may_ be something dreadful. [something dreadful - что-то ужасное]  Everything they say of you may be true. But it doesn’t matter to me.”

“You care that much for me, Valancy?” said Barney incredulously, looking away  [looking away - отводит взгляд] from the star and into her eyes—her strange, mysterious eyes. [mysterious eyes - загадочные глаза] 

“I care—that much,” said Valancy in a low voice. [low voice - тихий голос]  She was trembling. He had called her by her name for the first time. [first time - первый раз]  It was sweeter than another man’s caress could  [caress could -  ласкать мог] have been just to hear him say her name like  [name like - имя как] that.

“If we are going to get married,” said Barney, speaking suddenly  [speaking suddenly - говорить внезапно] in a casual, matter-of-fact voice, [fact voice - фактический голос]  “some things must  [things must - вещи должны] be understood.”

“Everything must be understood,” said Valancy.

“I have things I want to hide,” said Barney coolly. “You are not to ask me about them.”

“I won’t,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - », сказала вэлэнси] 

“You must never ask  [must never ask - никогда не должна спрашивать] to see my mail.”

“Never.”

“And we are never to pretend anything  [pretend anything - притворяться что-либо] to each other.”

“We won’t,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - », сказала вэлэнси]  “You won’t even have to pretend you like me. If you marry me I know you’re only doing it out of pity.”

“And we’ll never tell  [never tell - никогда не говорить] a lie to each other about anything—a big lie  [big lie - большая ложь] or a petty lie.”

“Especially a petty lie,” agreed Valancy.

“And you’ll have to live back  [live back - жить в ответ] on my island. I won’t live anywhere else.”

“That’s partly why I want to marry you,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - », сказала вэлэнси] 

Barney peered  [barney peered - барни посмотрел] at her.

“I believe you mean it. Well—let’s get married, [get married - жениться]  then.”

“Thank you,” said Valancy, [,” said valancy - , – сказал Валенси]  with a sudden return  [sudden return - внезапное возвращение] of primness. She would have been much less embarrassed  [much less embarrassed - много менее смущенный] if he had refused her.

“I suppose I haven’t any right to make conditions. [make conditions - сделай условия]  But I’m going to make one. [make one - сделай один]  You are never to refer to my heart or my liability to sudden death. [sudden death - внезапная смерть]  You are never to urge me to be careful. You are to forget—absolutely forget—that I’m not perfectly healthy. [perfectly healthy - совершенно здоров]  I have written a letter to my mother—here it is—you are to keep it. I have explained everything  [explained everything - объяснил все] in it. If I drop dead suddenly—as I likely will do——”

“It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion of having poisoned you,” said Barney  [,” said barney - , – сказал барни] with a grin.

“Exactly.” Valancy laughed gaily. “Dear me, I’m glad this is over. It has been—a bit of an ordeal. You see, I’m not in the habit of going about asking men  [asking men - спрашивая мужчин] to marry me. It is so nice of you not to refuse me—or offer to be a brother!”

“I’ll go to the Port tomorrow  [port tomorrow - порт завтра] and get a license. We can be married tomorrow evening. [married tomorrow evening - женат завтра вечером]  Dr. Stalling, I suppose?”

“Heavens, no.” Valancy shuddered. [.” valancy shuddered - ». вэлэнси вздрогнула]  “Besides, he wouldn’t do it. He’d shake his forefinger at me and I’d jilt you at the altar. No, I want my old Mr. [old mr - старый мистер]  Towers to marry me.”

“Will you marry me as I stand?” demanded Barney. A passing car, [passing car - проезжающая машина]  full of tourists, honked loudly—it seemed derisively. [seemed derisively - казалась насмешливой]  Valancy looked  [valancy looked - вэлэнси посмотрела] at him. Blue homespun shirt, [blue homespun shirt - синяя домотканая рубашка]  nondescript hat, [nondescript hat - невзрачная шляпа]  muddy overalls. [muddy overalls - грязный комбинезон]  Unshaved!

“Yes,” she said.

Barney put  [barney put - барни положил] his hands over the gate and took her little, cold ones gently  [cold ones gently - холодные нежно] in his.

“Valancy,” he said, trying to speak lightly, [speak lightly - говорить легкомысленно]  “of course I’m not in love with you—never thought of such a thing as being in love. But, do you know, I’ve always thought  [always thought - всегда думал] you were a bit of a dear.”



 CHAPTER XXVI [chapter xxvi - глава xxvi] 

 The next day passed  [next day passed - на следующий день прошел] for Valancy like  [valancy like - валэнси вроде] a dream. She could not make herself or anything she did seem real. [seem real - кажется реальным ]  She saw nothing  [saw nothing - ничего не видел] of Barney, though she expected he must go rattling past on his way to the Port for a license.

Perhaps he had changed his mind.

But at dusk the lights of Lady Jane suddenly swooped over the crest of the wooded hill beyond  [wooded hill beyond - лесистый холм за ним] the lane. Valancy was waiting at the gate for her bridegroom. She wore her green dress  [green dress - зеленого платья] and her green hat  [green hat - зеленой шляпы] because she had nothing else  [nothing else - ничего другого] to wear. She did not look or feel at all bride-like—she really looked like  [really looked like - действительно выглядел] a wild elf strayed  [wild elf strayed - дикий эльф заблудился] out of the greenwood. But that did not matter. Nothing at all mattered except  [mattered except - важно, кроме] that Barney was coming for her.

“Ready?” said Barney, stopping Lady Jane  [stopping lady jane - останавливающей леди джейн] with some new, horrible noises. [horrible noises - ужасные звуки] 

“Yes.” Valancy stepped in and sat down. Barney was in his blue shirt  [blue shirt - синяя рубашка] and overalls. But they were clean overalls. [clean overalls - чистый комбинезон ]  He was smoking a villainous-looking pipe  [looking pipe - смотрящая труба] and he was bareheaded. But he had a pair of oddly smart boots  [oddly smart boots - странно умные ботинки] on under his shabby overalls. [shabby overalls - потрепанный комбинезон]  And he was shaved. They clattered into Deerwood and through Deerwood and hit the long, wooded road  [wooded road - лесистая дорога] to the Port.

“Haven’t changed your mind?” said Barney.

“No. Have you?”

“No.”

That was their whole conversation  [whole conversation - весь разговор] on the fifteen miles. [fifteen miles - пятнадцать миль]  Everything was more dream-like than ever. Valancy didn’t know whether  [know whether - знаешь ли] she felt happy. [felt happy - чувствовал себя счастливым]  Or terrified. Or just plain fool. [plain fool - простой дурак] 

Then the lights of Port Lawrence  [port lawrence - порт лоуренс] were about them. Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валэнси войлок] as if she were surrounded by the gleaming, hungry eyes  [hungry eyes - голодные глаза] of hundreds of great, stealthy panthers. [stealthy panthers - незаметные пантеры ]  Barney briefly asked  [barney briefly asked - барни кратко спросил] where Mr. Towers lived, [towers lived - жилые башни]  and Valancy as briefly told  [briefly told - кратко рассказал] him. They stopped before the shabby little house  [shabby little house - убогий домишко] in an unfashionable street. [unfashionable street - немодная улица]  They went in to the small, shabby parlour. [shabby parlour - убогий салон]  Barney produced  [barney produced - барни продюсировал] his license. So he _had_ got it. Also a ring. This thing was real. She, Valancy Stirling, [valancy stirling - валэнси стирлинг]  was actually on the point of being married.

They were standing up together before Mr. Towers. Valancy heard Mr. [valancy heard mr - валэнси слышала, мистер]  Towers and Barney saying things. [barney saying things - барни что-то говорит]  She heard some other person saying things. [person saying things - человек говорит что-то]  She herself was thinking of the way she had once planned to be married—away back in her early teens  [early teens - ранние подростки] when such a thing had not seemed impossible. [seemed impossible - казалось невозможным]  White silk  [white silk - белый шелк] and tulle veil  [tulle veil - фата из тюля] and orange-blossoms; no bridesmaid. But one flower girl, [one flower girl - одна цветочница]  in a frock of cream shadow lace  [cream shadow lace - кружева кремовых теней] over pale pink, [pale pink - бледно-розовый]  with a wreath of flowers in her hair, carrying a basket of roses and lilies-of-the-valley. And the groom, a noble-looking creature, [looking creature - выглядит существо]  irreproachably clad  [irreproachably clad - безукоризненно одетые] in whatever the fashion of the day decreed. [day decreed - день определен]  Valancy lifted  [valancy lifted - валэнси приподнялась] her eyes and saw herself and Barney in the little, slanting, distorting mirror  [distorting mirror - кривое зеркало] over the mantelpiece. She in her odd, unbridal green hat  [unbridal green hat - несвадебная зеленая шляпа] and dress; Barney in shirt and overalls. But it was Barney. That was all that mattered. No veil—no flowers—no guests—no presents—no wedding-cake—but just Barney. For all the rest of her life there would be Barney.

“Mrs. Snaith, I hope you will be very happy,” Mr. Towers was saying.

“What a nice way  [nice way - хороший способ] to get married!” Barney was saying as he put Lady Jane  [put lady jane - положить леди джейн] in gear. “No fuss and flub-dub. I never supposed  [never supposed - никогда не предполагал] it was half so easy.”

“For heaven’s sake,” said Valancy suddenly, “let’s forget we _are_ married and talk as if we weren’t. I can’t stand another drive like the one we had coming in.”

Barney howled  [barney howled - барни выл] and threw Lady Jane  [threw lady jane - бросил леди джейн] into high with an infernal noise. [infernal noise - адский шум] 

“And I thought I was making it easy for you,” he said. “You didn’t seem to want to talk.”

“I didn’t. But I wanted you to talk. I don’t want you to make love  [make love - заниматься любовью] to me, but I want you to act like  [act like - действовать как] an ordinary human  [ordinary human - обычный человек] being. Tell me about this island of yours. What sort of a place is it?”

“The jolliest place  [jolliest place - весёлое место] in the world. You’re going to love it. The first time  [first time - впервые] I saw it I loved it. Old Tom MacMurray owned it then. He built the little shack  [little shack - маленькая лачуга] on it, lived there in winter and rented it to Toronto people  [toronto people - люди из торонто] in summer. I bought it from him—became by that one simple transaction  [one simple transaction - одна простая сделка] a landed proprietor owning  [landed proprietor owning - землевладелец, владеющий] a house and an island. There is something so satisfying in owning a whole island. [whole island - целым островом]  And isn’t an uninhabited island  [uninhabited island - необитаемый остров] a charming idea? [charming idea - очаровательная идея]  I’d wanted to own one ever since  [one ever since - с тех пор] I’d read _Robinson Crusoe_. It seemed too good to be true. And beauty! Most of the scenery belongs  [scenery belongs -  пейзаж принадлежит] to the government, but they don’t tax you for looking at it, and the moon belongs  [moon belongs - луна принадлежит] to everybody. You won’t find my shack very tidy. I suppose you’ll want to make it tidy.”

“Yes,” said Valancy honestly. “I _have_ to be tidy. I don’t really _want_ to be. But untidiness hurts  [untidiness hurts - неопрятность причиняет боль] me. Yes, I’ll have to tidy up your shack.”

“I was prepared for that,” said Barney, [,” said barney - , – сказал барни]  with a hollow groan. [hollow groan - глухой стон] 

“But,” continued Valancy relentingly, “I won’t insist on your wiping your feet when you come in.”

“No, you’ll only sweep up after me with the air of a martyr,” said Barney. “Well, anyway, you can’t tidy the lean-to. You can’t even enter  [even enter - даже входить] it. The door will be locked and I shall keep  [shall keep - будет продолжать] the key.”

“Bluebeard’s chamber,” said Valancy. “I shan’t even think  [even think - даже думать] of it. I don’t care how many wives  [many wives - много жен] you have hanging up in it. So long as they’re really dead.”

“Dead as door-nails. You can do as you like in the rest of the house. There’s not much of it—just one big living- [one big living - одна большая гостиная] room and one small bedroom. [one small bedroom - один маленькая спальня]  Well built, [well built - хорошо сложенная]  though. Old Tom loved  [old tom loved - старый том любил] his job. The beams of our house are cedar and the rafters fir. [rafters fir - стропильная ель]  Our living-room windows face west and east. It’s wonderful to have a room where you can see both sunrise and sunset. I have two cats  [two cats - две кошки] there. Banjo and Good Luck. [good luck - удачи]  Adorable animals. [adorable animals - очаровательные животные]  Banjo is a big, enchanting, grey devil- [grey devil - серый дьявол] cat. Striped, of course. I don’t care a hang for any cat that hasn’t stripes. I never knew  [never knew - никогда не знал] a cat who could swear  [could swear - могу поклясться] as genteelly and effectively as Banjo. His only fault is that he snores horribly  [snores horribly - ужасно храпит] when he is asleep. Luck is a dainty little cat. [dainty little cat - изящная маленькая кошка]  Always looking wistfully  [always looking wistfully - всегда смотрит с тоской] at you, as if he wanted to tell you something. Maybe he will pull it off sometime. Once in a thousand years, [thousand years - тысяча лет]  you know, one cat  [one cat - одна кошка] is allowed to speak. My cats are philosophers—neither of them ever cries  [ever cries - всегда плачет] over spilt milk. [spilt milk - пролитое молоко] 

“Two old crows live in a pine-tree on the point and are reasonably neighbourly. [reasonably neighbourly - достаточно добрососедские]  Call ’em Nip and Tuck. And I have a demure little tame owl. Name, Leander. I brought him up from a baby and he lives over on the mainland and chuckles to himself o’ nights. [’ nights -  ' ночи]  And bats—it’s a great place  [great place - отличное место] for bats at night. Scared of bats?”

“No; I like them.”

“So do I. Nice, queer, uncanny, mysterious creatures. [mysterious creatures - таинственные существа]  Coming from nowhere—going nowhere. Swoop! Banjo likes ’em, too. Eats ’em. I have a canoe and a disappearing propeller boat. [disappearing propeller boat - исчезающая пропеллерная лодка]  Went to the Port in it today to get my license. Quieter than Lady Jane.”

“I thought you hadn’t gone at all—that you _had_ changed your mind,” admitted Valancy.

Barney laughed—the laugh Valancy  [laugh valancy - смех валэнси] did not like—the little, bitter, cynical laugh. [cynical laugh - циничный смех] 

“I never change  [never change - никогда не меняться] my mind,” he said shortly. [said shortly - сказал коротко] 

They went back  [went back - вернуться] through Deerwood. Up the Muskoka road. [muskoka road - мускока-роуд]  Past Roaring Abel’s. Over the rocky, daisied lane. [daisied lane - маргаритка]  The dark pine woods  [pine woods - сосновый лес] swallowed them up. Through the pine woods, where the air was sweet with the incense of the unseen, fragile bells  [fragile bells - хрупкие колокольчики] of the linnæas that carpeted the banks of the trail. Out to the shore of Mistawis. Lady Jane must  [lady jane must - леди джейн должна] be left here. They got out. Barney led  [barney led -  барни вел] the way down a little path  [little path - тропинка] to the edge of the lake.

“There’s our island,” he said gloatingly. [said gloatingly - сказал злорадно] 

Valancy looked—and looked—and looked again. There was a diaphanous, lilac mist  [lilac mist - лиловый туман] on the lake, shrouding the island. Through it the two enormous pine- [two enormous pine - две огромные сосны] trees that clasped hands  [clasped hands - сцепились руки] over Barney’s shack loomed  [shack loomed - вырисовывалась лачуга] out like dark turrets. [like dark turrets - подобно темным башенкам]  Behind them was a sky still rose- [sky still rose - небо все еще поднималось] hued in the afterlight, and a pale young moon. [pale young moon - бледная молодая луна] 

Valancy shivered like  [valancy shivered like - валэнси вздрогнула как] a tree the wind stirs suddenly. [wind stirs suddenly - внезапно зашевелился ветер]  Something seemed  [something seemed - что-то показалось] to sweep over her soul.

“My Blue Castle!” she said. “Oh, my Blue Castle!”

They got into the canoe and paddled out to it. They left behind  [left behind - оставленные позади] the realm of everyday and things known  [things known - известные вещи] and landed on a realm of mystery and enchantment where anything might happen—anything might be true. Barney lifted Valancy  [barney lifted valancy - барни поднял вэйланси] out of the canoe and swung her to a lichen-covered rock  [covered rock - покрытый камнем] under a young pine- [young pine - молодой сосна] tree. His arms were about her and suddenly his lips were on hers. Valancy found  [valancy found - валэнси нашел] herself shivering with the rapture of her first kiss. [first kiss - первый поцелуй] 

“Welcome home, dear,” Barney was saying.



 CHAPTER XXVII [chapter xxvii - глава xxvii] 

 Cousin Georgiana  [cousin georgiana - двоюродный брат Джорджиана] came  [cousin georgiana came - кузен Джорджиана пришел] down the lane leading  [lane leading - ведущий переулок] up to her little house. [little house - маленький дом]  She lived half  [lived half - прожил половину ] a mile out of Deerwood and she wanted to go in to Amelia’s and find out if Doss had come home yet. [come home yet - приходи домой еще]  Cousin Georgiana was anxious to see Doss. [see doss - увидел бы досс]  She had something very important to tell her. Something, she was sure, Doss would  [doss would - досс бы] be delighted to hear. Poor Doss! [poor doss - бедный досс]  She _had_ had rather a dull life  [dull life - скучная жизнь] of it. Cousin Georgiana owned  [cousin georgiana owned - кузен Джорджиана владел] to herself that _she_ would not like to live under Amelia’s thumb. But that would be all changed now. Cousin Georgiana felt tremendously important. For the time being, she quite forgot  [quite forgot - совсем забыл] to wonder which of them would go next. [would go next - пойду дальше] 

And here was Doss herself, coming along  [coming along - появится] the road from Roaring Abel’s in such a queer green dress  [queer green dress - странное зеленое платье] and hat. Talk about luck. Cousin Georgiana would  [cousin georgiana would - кузина Джорджиана не стала бы] have a chance to impart her wonderful secret right away, with nobody else  [nobody else - никто другой] about to interrupt. It was, you might say, [might say - может сказать]  a Providence.

Valancy, who had been living for four days  [four days - четыре дня] on her enchanted island, [enchanted island - заколдованный остров]  had decided that she might as well go  [well go - иди] in to Deerwood and tell her relatives that she was married. Otherwise, finding that she had disappeared from Roaring Abel’s, they might get  [might get - может получить] out a search warrant  [search warrant - ордер на обыск] for her. Barney had offered to drive her in, but she had preferred to go alone. [go alone - идти в одиночестве]  She smiled very radiantly at Cousin Georgiana, [cousin georgiana - кузен Джорджиана]  who, she remembered, as of some one known  [one known - один известный] a long time ago, [long time ago - давным-давно]  had really been not a bad little creature. [bad little creature - плохое маленькое существо]  Valancy was so happy that she could have smiled at anybody—even Uncle James. She was not averse to Cousin Georgiana’s company. Already, since the houses along  [houses along -  дома вдоль] the road were becoming numerous, [becoming numerous - становится многочисленным]  she was conscious that curious eyes  [curious eyes - любопытные глаза] were looking at her from every window. [every window - каждое окно] 

“I suppose you’re going home, [going home - идти домой]  dear Doss?” said Cousin Georgiana as she shook hands—furtively eyeing Valancy’s dress and wondering if she had _any_ petticoat on at all.

“Sooner or later,” said Valancy cryptically.

“Then I’ll go along  [go along - идти вместе] with you. I’ve been wanting to see you very especially, Doss dear. [doss dear - ночует дорогой]  I’ve something quite _wonderful_ to tell you.”

“Yes?” said Valancy absently. What on earth was Cousin Georgiana looking  [cousin georgiana looking - кузина Джорджиана смотрит] so mysterious and important about? But did it matter? No. Nothing mattered  [nothing mattered - ничего не имеет значения] but Barney and the Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] up back in Mistawis.

“Who do you suppose called  [suppose called - предположим, звонил] to see me the other day?” asked Cousin Georgiana archly.

Valancy couldn’t guess.

“Edward Beck.” Cousin Georgiana lowered her voice almost  [voice almost - голос почти] to a whisper. “_Edward Beck_.”

Why the italics? And _was_ Cousin Georgiana blushing?

“Who on earth is Edward Beck?” asked Valancy indifferently.

Cousin Georgiana stared. [cousin georgiana stared - кузина Джорджиана смотрела] 

“Surely you remember Edward Beck,” she said reproachfully. [said reproachfully - сказал укоризненно]  “He lives in that lovely house  [lovely house - прекрасный дом] on the Port Lawrence road  [port lawrence road -  порт-лоуренс-роуд] and he comes to our church—regularly. You _must_ remember him.”

“Not dozens of children, dear—oh, no, not dozens. Not even _one_ dozen. Only nine. At least only nine that count. The rest are dead. He isn’t old—he’s only about forty-eight—the prime of life, Doss—and what does it matter about a wen?”

“Nothing, of course,” agreed Valancy quite sincerely. It certainly did not matter to her whether Edward Beck  [whether edward beck - будет ли Эдвард Бек] had a wen or a dozen wens  [dozen wens - дюжина жировиков] or no wen at all. But Valancy was getting vaguely suspicious. [getting vaguely suspicious - становится смутно подозрительным]  There was certainly an air of suppressed triumph  [suppressed triumph - подавленное торжество] about Cousin Georgiana. [cousin georgiana - кузина Джорджиана]  Could it be possible that Cousin Georgiana was thinking of marrying again? Marrying Edward Beck? [marrying edward beck - выходить замуж за Эдварда Бека]  Absurd. Cousin Georgiana was sixty-five if she were a day and her little anxious face  [little anxious face - немного встревоженное лицо] was as closely covered  [closely covered - плотно прикрыта] with fine wrinkles  [fine wrinkles - мелкие морщины] as if she had been a hundred. But still——

“My dear,” said Cousin Georgiana, “Edward Beck wants to marry _you_.”

Valancy stared  [valancy stared - валэнси смотрела] at Cousin Georgiana  [cousin georgiana - кузина Джорджиана] for a moment. Then she wanted to go off into a peal of laughter. But she only said:

“Me?”

“Yes, you. He fell in love with you at the funeral. And he came to consult me about it. I was such a friend of his first wife, [first wife - первая жена]  you know. He is very much in earnest, Dossie. And it’s a wonderful chance  [wonderful chance - чудесный шанс] for you. He’s very well off—and you know—you—you——”

“Am not so young as I once was,” agreed Valancy. [,” agreed valancy - », согласилась валентность]  “‘To her that hath shall  [hath shall - надо] be given.’ Do you really think  [really think - действительно думаю] I would make  [would make - выгодно ] a good stepmother, [good stepmother - хорошая мачеха]  Cousin Georgiana?”

“I’m sure you would. You were always so fond of children.”

“But nine is such a family to start with,” objected Valancy gravely.

“The two oldest  [two oldest - две старшие] are grown up and the third almost. [third almost - третий почти]  That leaves only six that really count. [really count - на самом деле считают]  And most of them are boys. So much easier  [much easier - намного проще] to bring up than girls. There’s an excellent book—‘Health Care of the Growing Child’—Gladys has a copy, I think. It would be such a help to you. And there are books about morals. You’d manage nicely. [manage nicely - хорошо управляются]  Of course I told Mr. [told mr - сказали мистеру]  Beck that I thought you would—would——”

“Jump at him,” supplied Valancy. [,” supplied valancy - », — добавила валентность] 

“Oh, no, no, dear. I wouldn’t use such an indelicate expression. [indelicate expression - неделикатное выражение]  I told him I thought you would consider  [would consider - рассмотрела бы] his proposal favourably. [proposal favourably - предложение благосклонно]  And you will, won’t you, dearie?”

“There’s only one obstacle,” said Valancy dreamily. “You see, I’m married already.”

“Married!” Cousin Georgiana stopped stock-still and stared at Valancy. “Married!”

“Yes. I was married to Barney Snaith last Tuesday evening in Port Lawrence.”

There was a convenient gate- [convenient gate - удобные ворота] post hard  [post hard - поставить трудно] by. Cousin Georgiana took firm hold of it.

“Doss, dear—I’m an old woman—are you trying to make fun  [make fun - подшутить ] of me?”

“Not at all. I’m only telling you the truth. For heaven’s sake, Cousin Georgiana,”—Valancy was alarmed by certain symptoms—“don’t go crying  [go crying - поплакать] here on the public road!”

Cousin Georgiana choked back the tears and gave a little moan  [little moan - небольшой стон] of despair instead. [despair instead - вместо отчаяния] 

“Oh, Doss, _what_ have you done? What _have_ you done?”

“I’ve just been telling you. I’ve got married,” said Valancy, calmly and patiently.

“To that—that—aw—that—_Barney Snaith_. Why, they say he’s had a dozen wives already.”

“I’m the only one round  [one round - один раунд] at present,” said Valancy.

“What will your poor mother say?” moaned Cousin Georgiana.

“Come along with me and hear, if you want to know,” said Valancy. “I’m on my way to tell her now.”

Cousin Georgiana  [cousin georgiana - двоюродный брат Джорджиана] let go the gate-post cautiously  [post cautiously - пост осторожно] and found that she could stand alone. [could stand alone - могу стоять в одиночестве]  She meekly trotted  [meekly trotted - кротко трусил] on beside Valancy—who suddenly seemed quite  [suddenly seemed quite - внезапно показалось вполне] a different person  [different person - другое человек] in her eyes. Cousin Georgiana had a tremendous respect  [tremendous respect - огромное уважение] for a married woman. [married woman - замужняя женщина]  But it was terrible to think of what the poor girl  [poor girl - бедная девочка] had done. So rash. So reckless. Of course Valancy must  [course valancy must - конечно, валентность должна] be stark mad. [stark mad - полное безумие]  But she seemed so happy in her madness that Cousin Georgiana had a momentary conviction  [momentary conviction - моментальное убеждение] that it would be a pity if the clan tried  [clan tried - клан пытался] to scold her back to sanity. She had never seen  [never seen - никогда не видел] that look in Valancy’s eyes before. But what _would_ Amelia say? And Ben?

“To marry a man you know nothing  [know nothing - ничего не знаю] about,” thought Cousin Georgiana aloud.

“I know more about him than I know of Edward Beck,” said Valancy.

“Edward Beck _goes to church_,” said Cousin Georgiana. “Does Bar—does your husband?”

“He has promised that he will go with me on fine Sundays,” said Valancy.

When they turned in at the Stirling gate Valancy gave an exclamation of surprise.

“Look at my rosebush! Why, it’s blooming!”

It was. Covered with blossoms. Great, crimson, velvety blossoms. [velvety blossoms - бархатные цветы]  Fragrant. Glowing. Wonderful.

“My cutting it to pieces must  [pieces must - кусочки должны] have done it good,” said Valancy, laughing. She gathered a handful of the blossoms—they would look well  [would look well - выглядело бы хорошо] on the supper-table of the verandah at Mistawis—and went, still laughing, [still laughing - все еще смеется]  up the walk, conscious that Olive was standing on the steps, Olive, goddess-like in loveliness, looking down with a slight frown  [slight frown - слегка нахмурился] on her forehead. Olive, beautiful, insolent. Her full form voluptuous  [full form voluptuous - полная форма сладострастная] in its swathings of rose silk  [rose silk - розовый шелк] and lace. Her golden-brown hair curling richly under her big, white-frilled hat. [frilled hat - шляпа с оборками]  Her colour ripe  [colour ripe - цвет спелый] and melting.

“Beautiful,” thought Valancy coolly, “but”—as if she suddenly saw  [suddenly saw - внезапно увидел] her cousin through new eyes—“without the slightest touch  [slightest touch - малейшее прикосновение] of distinction.”

So Valancy had come home, [come home - приходи домой]  thank goodness, [thank goodness - слава богу]  thought Olive. [thought olive -  мысли оливковая]  But Valancy was not looking like  [looking like - похоже] a repentant, returned prodigal. [returned prodigal - вернулся блудный сын]  This was the cause of Olive’s frown. She was looking triumphant—graceless! That outlandish dress—that queer hat—those hands full  [hands full - руки полны] of blood-red roses. [red roses - красные розы]  Yet there was something about both dress and hat, as Olive instantly felt, [olive instantly felt - оливковое сразу почувствовалось]  that was entirely lacking  [entirely lacking - совсем не хватает] in her own attire. This deepened the frown. She put out a condescending hand. [condescending hand - снисходительная рука] 

“So you’re back, Doss? Very warm day, [warm day - теплый день]  isn’t it? Did you walk in?”

“Yes. Coming in?”

“Oh, no. I’ve just been in. I’ve come often  [come often - приходи почаще] to comfort poor Aunty. [comfort poor aunty - утешить бедную тетушку]  She’s been so lonesome. I’m going to Mrs. Bartlett’s tea. I have to help pour. [help pour - помочь налить]  She’s giving it for her cousin from Toronto. Such a charming girl. [charming girl - очаровательная девушка]  You’d have loved meeting  [loved meeting - любимая встреча] her, Doss. I think Mrs. [think mrs - думаю миссис]  Bartlett did send you a card. Perhaps you’ll drop in later on.”

“No, I don’t think so,” said Valancy indifferently. “I’ll have to be home to get Barney’s supper. We’re going for a moonlit canoe ride around Mistawis tonight.”

“Barney? Supper?” gasped Olive. “What _do_ you mean, Valancy Stirling?”

“Valancy Snaith, by the grace of God.”

Valancy flaunted  [valancy flaunted - валэнси красовалась] her wedding-ring in Olive’s stricken face. [stricken face - пораженное лицо]  Then she nimbly stepped past  [nimbly stepped past - проворно прошла мимо] her and into the house. Cousin Georgiana followed. [cousin georgiana followed - кузина Джорджиана последовала]  She would not miss a moment of the great scene, [great scene - великолепная сцена]  even though Olive  [even though olive - несмотря на то, что оливка] did look as if she were going to faint.

Olive did not faint. She went stupidly  [went stupidly - пошла глупо] down the street to Mrs. Bartlett’s. _What_ did Doss mean? [doss mean - плохая подлая]  She couldn’t have—that ring—oh, what fresh scandal  [fresh scandal - свежий скандал] was that wretched girl bringing  [wretched girl bringing - несчастная девушка привела] on her defenceless family  [defenceless family - беззащитная семья] now? She should have been—shut up—long ago.

Valancy opened  [valancy opened -  открыта вэлэнси] the sitting-room door  [room door - дверь в комнату] and stepped unexpectedly right  [stepped unexpectedly right - неожиданно сделала правильный шаг] into a grim assemblage  [grim assemblage - мрачное собрание] of Stirlings. They had not come together  [come together - сойтись] of malice prepense. [malice prepense - умышленное намерение]  Aunt Wellington  [aunt wellington - тетя веллингтон] and Cousin Gladys  [cousin gladys - кузина Глэдис] and Aunt Mildred  [aunt mildred - тетя милдред] and Cousin Sarah  [cousin sarah - двоюродный брат Сара] had just called in on their way home  [way home - дорога домой] from a meeting of the missionary society. [missionary society - миссионерское общество]  Uncle James  [uncle james - дядя джеймс] had dropped in to give Amelia  [give amelia - дайте Амелию] some information regarding  [information regarding - информация о] a doubtful investment. [doubtful investment - сомнительные инвестиции]  Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] had called, apparently, to tell them it was a hot day  [hot day - жаркий день] and ask them what was the difference between a bee and a donkey. Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - кузен Стиклз] had been tactless enough  [tactless enough - достаточно бестактно] to know the answer—“one gets all the honey, the other all the whacks”—and Uncle Benjamin was in a bad humour. [bad humour - плохой юмор ]  In all of their minds, unexpressed, was the idea of finding out if Valancy had yet come home, [yet come home - но вернулась домой]  and, if not, what steps must  [steps must - шаги должны] be taken in the matter.

Well, here was Valancy at last, a poised, confident thing, [confident thing - уверенная вещь]  not humble and deprecating as she should have been. And so oddly, improperly young- [improperly young - неправильно молодая] looking. She stood in the doorway and looked at them, Cousin Georgiana timorous, [cousin georgiana timorous - двоюродная сестра джорджиана боязливая]  expectant, behind her. Valancy was so happy she didn’t hate her people any more. She could even see  [could even see - могла даже видеть] a number of good qualities  [good qualities - хорошие качества] in them that she had never seen  [never seen - никогда не видела] before. And she was sorry for them. Her pity made  [pity made - жалость сделана] her quite gentle. [quite gentle - довольно нежная] 

“Well, Mother,” she said pleasantly. [said pleasantly - вежливо сказала] 

“So you’ve come home  [come home - приходи домой] at last!” said Mrs. Frederick, getting out a handkerchief. She dared not be outraged, but she did not mean to be cheated of her tears.

“Well, not exactly,” said Valancy. She threw her bomb. “I thought I ought to drop in and tell you I was married. Last Tuesday night. [last tuesday night - в прошлый вторник вечером]  To Barney Snaith.”

Uncle Benjamin bounced  [uncle benjamin bounced - дядя бенджамин подпрыгнул] up and sat down again.

“She would have to keep up the Victorian traditions,” said Valancy, with a grin. She sat down, uninvited, on a chair. Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - кузен стиклс] had begun to sob.

“Is there _one_ day in your life that you haven’t cried?” asked Valancy curiously.

“Valancy,” said Uncle James, being the first to recover the power of utterance, “did you mean what you said just now?”

“I did.”

“Do you mean to say that you have actually gone  [actually gone - на самом деле ушел] and married—_married_—that notorious Barney Snaith—that—that—criminal—that——”

“I have.”

“Then,” said Uncle James violently, “you are a shameless creature, [shameless creature - бессовестное существо]  lost to all sense of propriety and virtue, and I wash my hands entirely  [hands entirely - руки совсем] of you. I do not want ever  [want ever - хочу когда-нибудь] to see your face again.”

“What have you left to say when I commit murder?” asked Valancy.

Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] again appealed to God to bless his soul.

“That drunken outlaw—that——”

A dangerous spark appeared  [dangerous spark appeared - появилась опасная искра] in Valancy’s eyes. They might say  [might say - можно сказать] what they liked to and of her but they should not abuse Barney. [abuse barney - ругать барни] 

“Say ‘damn’ and you’ll feel better,” she suggested.

“I can express my feelings without blasphemy. [feelings without blasphemy - чувства без богохульства]  And I tell you have covered yourself with eternal disgrace  [eternal disgrace - вечный позор] and infamy by marrying that drunkard——”

“_You_ would be more endurable if you got drunk occasionally. [got drunk occasionally - напивался изредка]  Barney is _not_ a drunkard.”

“He was seen drunk  [seen drunk - видел пьяным] in Port Lawrence—pickled to the gills,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“If that is true—and I don’t believe it—he had a good reason  [good reason - уважительная причина] for it. Now I suggest that you all stop looking tragic  [stop looking tragic - перестань выглядеть трагически] and accept the situation. I’m married—you can’t undo that. And I’m perfectly happy.”

“I suppose we ought to be thankful he has really married  [really married - действительно женат] her,” said Cousin Sarah, by way of trying to look on the bright side. [bright side - светлая сторона] 

“If he really has,” said Uncle James, who had just washed his hands of Valancy. “Who married you?”

“Mr. Towers, of Port Lawrence.”

“By a Free Methodist!” groaned Mrs. Frederick—as if to have been married by an imprisoned Methodist would  [imprisoned methodist would - заключенный методист будет] have been a shade less disgraceful. [shade less disgraceful - оттенок менее позорный]  It was the first thing  [first thing - первое дело] she had said. Mrs. Frederick didn’t know _what_ to say. The whole thing  [whole thing - все это] was too horrible—too nightmarish. She was sure she must wake  [must wake - должен проснуться] up soon. After all their bright hopes  [bright hopes - светлые надежды] at the funeral!

“It makes me think of those what-d’ye-call-’ems,” said Uncle Benjamin helplessly. “Those yarns—you know—of fairies taking babies  [fairies taking babies - феи, берущие детей] out of their cradles.”

“Valancy could hardly be a changeling at twenty-nine,” said Aunt Wellington satirically.

“She was the oddest-looking baby  [looking baby - выглядит ребенком] I ever saw, [ever saw - когда-либо видел]  anyway,” averred Uncle Benjamin. “I said so at the time—you remember, Amelia? I said I had never seen  [never seen - никогда не видел] such eyes in a human head.”

“I’m glad _I_ never had any children,” said Cousin Sarah. “If they don’t break your heart in one way  [one way - один из способов] they do it in another.”

“Isn’t it better to have your heart broken  [heart broken - сердце разбито] than to have it wither up?” queried Valancy. “Before it could be broken it must have felt something splendid. [felt something splendid - почувствовал что-то великолепное]  _That_ would be worth the pain.”

“Dippy—clean dippy,” muttered Uncle Benjamin, with a vague, unsatisfactory feeling  [unsatisfactory feeling - неудовлетворительное чувство] that somebody had said something like  [said something like - что-то сказал как] that before.

“Valancy,” said Mrs. Frederick solemnly, [frederick solemnly - фредерик торжественно]  “do you ever pray  [ever pray - всегда молиться] to be forgiven for disobeying your mother?”

“I _should_ pray to be forgiven for obeying you so long,” said Valancy stubbornly. “But I don’t pray about that at all. I just thank God every day for my happiness.”

“I would rather,” said Mrs. Frederick, beginning to cry rather belatedly, [cry rather belatedly - плакать довольно запоздало]  “see you dead before me than listen to what you have told me today.”

Valancy looked  [valancy looked - валэнси выглядела] at her mother and aunts, and wondered if they could ever  [could ever - могла когда-либо] have known anything  [known anything - ничего не знала] of the real meaning  [real meaning - подлинное значение] of love. She felt sorrier  [felt sorrier - чувствовала себя более жалко] for them than ever. They were so very pitiable. And they never suspected  [never suspected - никогда не подозревала] it.

“Barney Snaith is a scoundrel to have deluded you into marrying him,” said Uncle James violently.

“Oh, _I_ did the deluding. I asked _him_ to marry me,” said Valancy, [,” said valancy - , – сказала вэланси]  with a wicked smile. [wicked smile - злая улыбка] 

“Have you _no_ pride?” demanded Aunt Wellington.

“Lots of it. I am proud that I have achieved a husband by my own unaided efforts. [unaided efforts - самостоятельные усилия]  Cousin Georgiana  [cousin georgiana - кузина Джорджиана] here wanted to help me to Edward Beck.”

“Edward Beck is worth twenty thousand dollars and has the finest house  [finest house - лучший дом] between here and Port Lawrence,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“That sounds very fine,” said Valancy scornfully, “but it isn’t worth _that_“—she snapped her fingers—“compared to feeling Barney’s arms around  [arms around -  обнять] me and his cheek against mine.”

“_Oh_, Doss!” said Cousin Stickles. Cousin Sarah said, [cousin sarah said - двоюродная сестра Сара сказала]  “Oh, _Doss_!” Aunt Wellington said, “Valancy, you need not be indecent.”

“Why, it surely isn’t indecent to like to have your husband put  [husband put - муж положил] his arm around  [arm around - обнять] you? I should think it would be indecent if you didn’t.”

“Why expect decency  [expect decency - ожидать приличия] from her?” inquired Uncle James sarcastically. “She has cut herself off from decency forevermore. [decency forevermore - приличия навсегда]  She has made her bed. Let her lie on it.”

“Thanks,” said Valancy very gratefully. “How you would have enjoyed being Torquemada! Now, I must really  [must really - должны действительно] be getting back. [getting back - возвращаться]  Mother, may I have those three woollen cushions  [three woollen cushions - три шерстяные подушки] I worked last winter?”

“Take them—take everything!” said Mrs. Frederick.

“Oh, I don’t want everything—or much. I don’t want my Blue Castle cluttered. [blue castle cluttered - голубой замок захламлен]  Just the cushions. I’ll call for them some day when we motor in.”

Valancy rose  [valancy rose - валэнси роза] and went to the door. There she turned. She was sorrier than ever for them all. _They_ had no Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] in the purple solitudes  [purple solitudes - фиолетовое одиночество] of Mistawis.

“The trouble with you people is that you don’t laugh enough,” she said.

“Doss, dear,” said Cousin Georgiana mournfully, “some day you will discover that blood is thicker than water.”

“Of course it is. But who wants water  [wants water - хочет воды] to be thick?” parried Valancy. “We want water  [want water - хочет воды] to be thin—sparkling—crystal-clear.”

Cousin Stickles groaned. [cousin stickles groaned - двоюродные палочки стонал] 

Valancy would  [valancy would - валенси] not ask any of them to come and see her—she was afraid they _would_ come out of curiosity. But she said:

“Do you mind if I drop in and see you once in a while, Mother?”

“My house will always be open to you,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs - , – сказала миссис]  Frederick, with a mournful dignity. [mournful dignity - скорбное достоинство] 

“You should never recognise  [never recognise - никогда не узнаю] her again,” said Uncle James sternly, as the door closed behind Valancy.

“I cannot quite forget  [cannot quite forget - не могу забыть] that I am a mother,” said Mrs. Frederick. “My poor, unfortunate girl!”

“I dare say  [dare say - прозвучит] the marriage isn’t legal,” said Uncle James comfortingly. “He has probably been married half  [married half - замужем полдюжины раз] a dozen times  [dozen times - смею сказать] before. But _I_ am through with her. I have done all I could, Amelia. I think you will admit that. Henceforth”—Uncle James was terribly solemn  [terribly solemn - ужасно торжественная] about it—“Valancy is to me as one dead.”

“Mrs. Barney Snaith,” said Cousin Georgiana, as if trying it out to see how it would sound. [would sound - наполовину индеец] 

“He has a score of aliases, no doubt,” said Uncle Benjamin. “For my part, I believe the man is half Indian. [half indian - настоящее имя]  I haven’t a doubt they’re living in a wigwam.”

“If he has married her under the name of Snaith and it isn’t his real name  [real name - брак недействителен] wouldn’t that make the marriage null  [marriage null - дядя джеймс потряс] and void?” asked Cousin Stickles hopefully.

Uncle James shook  [uncle james shook - пошел домой ] his head.

“No, it is the man who marries, not the name.”

“You know,” said Cousin Gladys, who had recovered and returned but was still shaky, [still shaky - серебряный ужин]  “I had a distinct premonition  [distinct premonition - защита снэйта] of this at Herbert’s silver dinner. [silver dinner - отчетливое предчувствие]  I remarked it at the time. When she was defending Snaith. [defending snaith - дядя джеймс]  You remember, of course. It came over me like a revelation. I spoke to David when I went home  [went home - все еще шатко] about it.”

“What—_what_,” demanded Aunt Wellington of the universe, “has come over Valancy? _Valancy_!”

The universe did not answer but Uncle James  [uncle james - обрезка второстепенных личностей] did.

“Isn’t there something coming  [something coming - бессмысленные понятия] up of late about secondary personalities cropping  [secondary personalities cropping - объявит] out? I don’t hold with many of those new-fangled notions, [fangled notions - ошибка жизни]  but there may be something in this one. It would account  [would account - что-то грядет] for her incomprehensible conduct.”

“Valancy is so fond of mushrooms,” sighed Cousin Georgiana. “I’m afraid she’ll get poisoned eating toadstools by mistake living  [mistake living - хуже] up back in the woods.”

“There are worse things  [worse things - в первый раз] than death,” said Uncle James, believing that it was the first time  [first time - может упасть замертво] in the world that such a statement had been made.

“Nothing can ever be the same again!” sobbed Cousin Stickles.

Valancy, hurrying along  [hurrying along - пыльной дороге ] the dusty road, [dusty road - крутой миставис]  back to cool Mistawis  [cool mistawis - глава xxviii] and her purple island, [purple island - спешит по]  had forgotten all about them—just as she had forgotten that she might drop dead  [might drop dead - фиолетовый остров] at any moment if she hurried.



 CHAPTER XXVIII [chapter xxviii - мыслящая девушка прочь] 

 Summer passed  [summer passed - повторяющиеся воскрешения] by. The Stirling clan—with the insignificant exception  [insignificant exception - призрачная привычка] of Cousin Georgiana—had tacitly agreed  [tacitly agreed - лето прошло] to follow Uncle James’ example and look upon Valancy  [look upon valancy - валенси один] as one dead. [one dead - никогда не существовало]  To be sure, Valancy had an unquiet, ghostly habit  [ghostly habit - покупать продукты ] of recurring resurrections  [recurring resurrections - один мертвый] when she and Barney clattered  [barney clattered - всегда бритый] through Deerwood and out to the Port in that unspeakable car. [unspeakable car - сказал Барни]  Valancy, bareheaded, with stars in her eyes. Barney, bareheaded, smoking his pipe. But shaved. Always shaved  [always shaved - сказал хладнокровно] now, if any of them had noticed it. They even had the audacity to go in to Uncle Benjamin’s store to buy groceries. [buy groceries - барни стучал]  Twice Uncle Benjamin ignored them. Was not Valancy one  [valancy one - невыразимая машина] of the dead? While Snaith had never existed. [never existed - несущественное исключение]  But the third time  [third time - молчаливое согласие] he told Barney  [told barney - в третий раз] he was a scoundrel who should be hung for luring an unfortunate, weak-minded girl away  [minded girl away - взгляните на валентность] from her home and friends.

Barney’s one straight eyebrow went up.

“I have made her happy,” he said coolly, [said coolly - дядя бенджамин пялился]  “and she was miserable with her friends. So that’s that.”

Uncle Benjamin stared. [uncle benjamin stared - никогда не происходило]  It had never occurred  [never occurred - что-то достойное] to him that women had to be, or ought to be, “made happy.”

“You—you pup!” he said.

“Why be so unoriginal?” queried Barney amiably. “Anybody could call me a pup. Why not think of something worthy  [something worthy - действительно совсем] of the Stirlings? Besides, I’m not a pup. I’m really quite  [really quite - пожилая собака] a middle-aged dog. [aged dog - дядя бенджамин помнил]  Thirty-five, if you’re interested in knowing.”

Uncle Benjamin remembered  [uncle benjamin remembered - каждый день открывал] just in time that Valancy was dead. He turned his back on Barney.

Valancy _was_ happy—gloriously and entirely so. She seemed to be living in a wonderful house  [wonderful house - ни в прошлом] of life and every day opened  [every day opened - замечательный дом] a new, mysterious room. [mysterious room - барни беззастенчиво цитировал]  It was in a world which had nothing in common with the one she had left behind—a world where time was not—which was young with immortal youth—where there was neither past  [neither past - таинственная комната] nor future but only the present. She surrendered herself utterly to the charm of it.

The absolute freedom  [absolute freedom - знаменитые покрывала с фитильными свечами] of it all was unbelievable. They could do exactly as they liked. No Mrs. Grundy. No traditions. No relatives. Or in-laws. “Peace, perfect peace, [perfect peace -  абсолютная свобода]  with loved ones far away,” as Barney quoted shamelessly. [barney quoted shamelessly - прекрасный мир] 

“But I haven’t got any spare-room,” said Valancy.

Cousin Georgiana looked horrified. A house without  [house without - дом без] a spare-room was monstrous to her.

“But it’s a lovely spread,” said Valancy, with a kiss, “and I’m so glad to have it. I’ll put it on my own bed. Barney’s old patch- [old patch - старый пластырь] work quilt  [work quilt - рабочее одеяло] is getting ragged.”

“I don’t see how you can be contented to live up back,” sighed Cousin Georgiana. “It’s so out of the world.”

“Contented!” Valancy laughed. What was the use of trying to explain to Cousin Georgiana. [cousin georgiana - кузен джорджиана]  “It is,” she agreed, “most gloriously and entirely out of the world.”

“And you are really happy, [really happy - действительно счастлив]  dear?” asked Cousin Georgiana wistfully.

“I really am,” said Valancy gravely, her eyes dancing. [eyes dancing - глаза танцуют] 

“Marriage is such a serious thing,” sighed Cousin Georgiana.

“When it’s going to last long,” agreed Valancy.

Cousin Georgiana  [cousin georgiana - кузен джорджиана] did not understand this at all. But it worried her and she lay awake  [lay awake - не спали] at nights wondering  [nights wondering - ночи в раздумьях] what Valancy meant  [valancy meant - значение валентности] by it.

Valancy loved  [valancy loved - валэнси любила] her Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] and was completely satisfied  [completely satisfied - полностью доволен] with it. The big living- [big living - большая гостиная] room had three windows, [three windows - три окна]  all commanding exquisite views  [commanding exquisite views - командование изысканными видами] of exquisite Mistawis. [exquisite mistawis - изысканный миставис]  The one in the end of the room was an oriel window—which Tom MacMurray, [tom macmurray - том макмюррей]  Barney explained, [barney explained - барни объяснил]  had got out of some little, old “u [old “ - старый «] p back” church that had been sold. It faced the west and when the sunsets flooded  [sunsets flooded - затопленные закаты] it Valancy’s whole being knelt in prayer as if in some great cathedral. [great cathedral - большой собор]  The new moons always looked down through it, the lower pine boughs swayed about the top of it, and all through the nights the soft, dim silver  [dim silver - тусклое серебро] of the lake dreamed  [lake dreamed - озеро приснилось] through it.

There was a stone fireplace  [stone fireplace - каменный камин] on the other side. No desecrating gas imitation  [desecrating gas imitation - оскверняющая газовая имитация] but a real fireplace  [real fireplace - настоящий камин] where you could burn real logs. With a big grizzly bearskin  [big grizzly bearskin - большая медвежья шкура гризли] on the floor before it, and beside it a hideous, red-plush sofa  [plush sofa - плюшевый диван] of Tom MacMurray’s régime. But its ugliness was hidden by silver-grey timber wolf skins, and Valancy’s cushions made  [cushions made - сделаны подушки] it gay and comfortable. In a corner a nice, tall, lazy old clock ticked—the right kind  [right kind - правильный вид] of a clock. One that did not hurry the hours away  [hours away - часы в пути] but ticked them off deliberately. It was the jolliest looking old clock. A fat, corpulent clock  [corpulent clock - тучные часы] with a great, round, man’s face painted  [face painted - лицо разрисовано] on it, the hands stretching  [hands stretching - руки растяжка] out of its nose and the hours encircling  [hours encircling - часы вокруг] it like a halo.

There was a big glass case  [big glass case - большой стеклянный шкаф] of stuffed owls  [stuffed owls - чучела сов] and several deer heads—likewise of Tom MacMurray’s vintage. Some comfortable old chairs  [comfortable old chairs - удобные старые стулья] that asked to be sat upon. [sat upon - сидел на]  A squat little chair  [squat little chair - приземистое маленькое кресло] with a cushion was prescriptively Banjo’s. If anybody else dared sit on it Banjo glared  [banjo glared - банджо сверкнуло] him out of it with his topaz-hued, black-ringed eyes. [ringed eyes - обведенные глаза]  Banjo had an adorable habit  [adorable habit -  очаровательная привычка] of hanging over the back of it, trying to catch his own tail. Losing his temper because he couldn’t catch it. Giving it a fierce bite  [fierce bite - жестокий укус] for spite when he _did_ catch it. Yowling malignantly  [yowling malignantly - злобно воет] with pain. Barney and Valancy laughed  [valancy laughed - валенси рассмеялся] at him until they ached. But it was Good Luck  [good luck - удачи] they loved. They were both agreed that Good Luck was so lovable that he practically amounted  [practically amounted - практически составил] to an obsession.

One side  [one side - одна сторона] of the wall was lined with rough, homemade book- [homemade book - самодельная книга] shelves filled  [shelves filled - полки заполнены] with books, and between the two side windows hung an old mirror  [old mirror - старое зеркало] in a faded gilt frame, [faded gilt frame - выцветшая позолоченная рама]  with fat cupids gamboling  [fat cupids gamboling - жирные амуры резвятся] in the panel over the glass. A mirror, Valancy thought, [valancy thought - галантность мысли]  that must be like the fabled mirror  [fabled mirror - сказочное зеркало] into which Venus had once looked and which thereafter reflected  [thereafter reflected - после этого отражается] as beautiful every woman  [beautiful every woman - красивая каждая женщина] who looked into it. Valancy thought she was almost pretty  [almost pretty - почти хорошенькая] in that mirror. But that may have been because she had shingled her hair.

This was before the day of bobs and was regarded as a wild, unheard-of proceeding—unless you had typhoid. When Mrs. Frederick heard  [frederick heard - Фредерик Херд] of it she almost decided  [almost decided - почти решил] to erase Valancy’s name from the family Bible. [family bible - семейная библия]  Barney cut  [barney cut - вырез Барни] the hair, square off at the back of Valancy’s neck, bringing it down in a short black fringe  [short black fringe - короткая черная бахрома] over her forehead. It gave a meaning and a purpose to her little, three-cornered face  [cornered face - угловатое лицо] that it never had possessed before. Even her nose ceased  [nose ceased - нос перестал] to irritate her. Her eyes were bright, and her sallow skin  [sallow skin - бледная кожа] had cleared to the hue of creamy ivory. [creamy ivory - кремовый цвет слоновой кости]  The old family joke  [old family joke - старая семейная шутка ] had come true—she was really fat  [really fat - действительно толстый] at last—anyway, no longer skinny. [longer skinny - длиннее худой]  Valancy might never  [valancy might never - валанси, возможно, никогда] be beautiful, but she was of the type that looks its best in the woods—elfin—mocking—alluring.

Her heart bothered  [heart bothered - сердце беспокоило] her very little. When an attack threatened  [attack threatened - угроза нападения] she was generally able  [generally able - в целом способный] to head it off with Dr. Trent’s prescription. The only bad one  [bad one - плохой] she had was one night  [one night - одна ночь] when she was temporarily out of medicine. And it _was_ a bad one. For the time being, Valancy realised keenly  [valancy realised keenly - важность остро осознала] that death was actually waiting  [actually waiting -  на самом деле ждет] to pounce on her any moment. But the rest of the time she would not—did not—let herself remember it at all.



 CHAPTER XXIX [chapter xxix - глава xxix] 

 Valancy toiled  [valancy toiled - валэнси трудилась] not, neither did she spin. There was really very little work  [little work - небольшая работа] to do. She cooked their meals on a coal-oil stove, [oil stove - масляная печь]  performing all her little domestic rites carefully and exultingly, and they ate out on the verandah that almost overhung  [almost overhung - почти нависла] the lake. Before them lay Mistawis, [lay mistawis - укладка миставис]  like a scene out of some fairy tale  [fairy tale - сказка] of old time. [old time - старое время]  And Barney smiling  [barney smiling - барни улыбается] his twisted, enigmatical smile  [enigmatical smile - загадочная улыбка] at her across the table.

“What a view old Tom picked out when he built this shack!” Barney would say exultantly.

Supper was the meal Valancy liked best. The faint laughter  [faint laughter - слабый смех] of winds was always about them and the colours of Mistawis, imperial and spiritual, under the changing clouds  [changing clouds - изменяющиеся облака] were something that cannot be expressed in mere words. [mere words - просто слова]  Shadows, too. Clustering in the pines until a wind shook  [wind shook - ветер тряс] them out and pursued them over Mistawis. They lay all day along  [day along - день напролет] the shores, threaded by ferns and wild blossoms. [wild blossoms - дикие цветы]  They stole around  [stole around - крался вокруг] the headlands in the glow of the sunset, until twilight wove  [twilight wove - сумерки плелись] them all into one great web  [one great web - одна большая паутина] of dusk.

The cats, with their wise, innocent little faces, [innocent little faces - невинные рожицы]  would sit  [would sit - сидел] on the verandah railing  [verandah railing - перила веранды] and eat the tidbits Barney flung  [tidbits barney flung - лакомые кусочки, которые барни швырял] them. And how good everything tasted! [good everything tasted - хорошее все на вкус]  Valancy, amid all the romance of Mistawis, never forgot  [never forgot - никогда не забывал] that men had stomachs. Barney paid  [barney paid - барни платил] her no end of compliments on her cooking.

“After all,” he admitted, “there’s something to be said for square meals. [square meals - квадратные обеды]  I’ve mostly got along  [mostly got along - в основном ладил] by boiling two  [boiling two - варил два] or three dozen eggs hard at once and eating a few when I got hungry, [got hungry - проголодался]  with a slice of bacon once in a while and a jorum of tea.”

Valancy poured tea  [valancy poured tea - валанс налил чай] out of Barney’s little battered old pewter teapot of incredible age. [incredible age - невероятный возраст]  She had not even a set of dishes—only Barney’s mismatched chipped bits—and a dear, big, pobby old jug  [pobby old jug - побби старый кувшин] of robin’s-egg blue. [egg blue - яично-голубой] 

There were plenty of other islands in sight, though none  [though none - хотя нет] were near enough  [near enough - достаточно близко] to be troublesome as neighbours. There was one little group  [one little group - одна маленькая группа] of islets far  [islets far - островки далеко] off to the west which they called the Fortunate Isles. [fortunate isles - счастливые острова]  At sunrise they looked like  [looked like - похоже на] a cluster of emeralds, at sunset like  [sunset like - закат как] a cluster of amethysts. They were too small for houses; but the lights on the larger islands would bloom out all over the lake, and bonfires would  [bonfires would - костры будут] be lighted on their shores, streaming up into the wood shadows  [wood shadows - деревянные тени] and throwing great, [throwing great - великолепно]  blood-red ribbons  [red ribbons - красные ленточки] over the waters. Music would drift  [music would drift - музыка будет дрейфовать] to them alluringly from boats here and there, or from the verandahs on the big house  [big house - большой дом] of the millionaire on the biggest island. [biggest island - самый большой остров] 

“Would you like a house like  [house like - дом как] that, Moonlight?” Barney asked once, waving his hand at it. He had taken to calling her Moonlight, and Valancy loved  [valancy loved - валэнси любил] it.

“No,” said Valancy, [,” said valancy - », — сказала Валенси]  who had once dreamed of a mountain castle ten times the size of the rich man’s “cottage” and now pitied the poor inhabitants  [poor inhabitants - бедные жители] of palaces. “No. It’s too elegant. I would have to carry it with me everywhere I went. On my back like  [back like - назад как] a snail. It would own me—possess me, body and soul. I like a house I can love and cuddle and boss. Just like ours here. I don’t envy Hamilton Gossard ‘the finest summer residence  [finest summer residence -  лучшая летняя резиденция] in Canada.’ It is magnificent, but it isn’t my Blue Castle.”

Away down at the far end  [far end - дальний конец] of the lake they got every night  [got every night - каждую ночь] a glimpse of a big, continental train rushing  [continental train rushing - континентальный поезд мчит] through a clearing. Valancy liked  [valancy liked - валенси понравилась] to watch its lighted windows flash  [lighted windows flash - освещенные окна вспыхивают] by and wonder who was on it and what hopes and fears it carried. She also amused  [also amused - тоже забавно] herself by picturing Barney  [picturing barney - воображая Барни] and herself going to the dances and dinners in the houses on the islands, but she did not want to go in reality. Once they did go to a masquerade dance  [masquerade dance - маскарадный танец] in the pavilion at one of the hotels up the lake, and had a glorious evening, [glorious evening - великолепный вечер]  but slipped away  [slipped away - ускользнула] in their canoe, before unmasking time, [unmasking time - разоблачая время]  back to the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок ] 

“It was lovely—but I don’t want to go again,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , – сказала Валенси] 

So many hours  [many hours - много часов] a day Barney shut  [day barney shut - день, когда Барни закрылся] himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber. Valancy never saw  [valancy never saw - Вэлэнси никогда не видела] the inside of it. From the smells that filtered through at times she concluded he must be conducting chemical experiments—or counterfeiting money. [counterfeiting money - подделку денег]  Valancy supposed  [valancy supposed - Вэлэнси предполагала] there must be smelly processes  [smelly processes - вонючие процессы] in making counterfeit money. [making counterfeit money - делала фальшивые деньги]  But she did not trouble herself about it. She had no desire to peer into the locked chambers  [locked chambers - запертые камеры] of Barney’s house of life. His past and his future concerned  [future concerned - забота о будущем] her not. Only this rapturous present. [rapturous present - восторженное настоящее]  Nothing else mattered. [nothing else mattered - ничего другого не имело значения] 

Once he went away  [went away - ушла] and stayed away two days and nights. He had asked Valancy  [asked valancy - спрашивал Валэнси] if she would be afraid to stay alone  [stay alone - оставаться в одиночестве] and she had said she would not. He never told  [never told - никогда не говорил] her where he had been. She was not afraid to be alone, but she was horribly lonely. [horribly lonely - ужасно одиноко]  The sweetest sound  [sweetest sound - самая сладкая звук] she had ever heard  [ever heard - когда-либо слышал] was Lady Jane’s clatter through the woods when Barney returned. [barney returned - барни вернулся]  And then his signal whistle  [signal whistle - сигнальный свисток] from the shore. She ran down to the landing rock  [landing rock - приземляющийся камень] to greet him—to nestle herself into his eager arms—they _did_ seem eager.

“Have you missed me, Moonlight?” Barney was whispering.

“It seems a hundred years since  [hundred years since - сто лет назад] you went away,” said Valancy.

“I won’t leave you again.”

“You must,” protested Valancy, “if you want to. I’d be miserable if I thought you wanted to go and didn’t, because of me. I want you to feel perfectly free.”

Barney laughed—a little cynically. [little cynically - немного цинично] 

“There is no such thing as freedom on earth,” he said. “Only different kinds  [different kinds - разные виды] of bondages. And comparative bondages. [comparative bondages - сравнительные кабалы]  _You_ think you are free now because you’ve escaped from a peculiarly unbearable kind  [peculiarly unbearable kind - особенно невыносимый вид] of bondage. But are you? You love me—_that’s_ a bondage.”

“Who said or wrote that ‘the prison unto  [prison unto - тюрьма к] which we doom ourselves no prison is’?” asked Valancy dreamily, clinging to his arm as they climbed up the rock steps. [rock steps - каменные ступени] 

“Ah, now you have it,” said Barney. [,” said barney - , ” сказал барни]  “That’s all the freedom we can hope for—the freedom to choose our prison. But, Moonlight,”—he stopped at the door of the Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] and looked about him—at the glorious lake, [glorious lake - великолепное озеро]  the great, shadowy woods, [shadowy woods - тенистый лес]  the bonfires, the twinkling lights—“Moonlight, I’m glad to be home again. When I came down through the woods and saw my home lights—mine—gleaming out under the old pines—something I’d never seen  [never seen - никогда не виданный] before—oh, girl, I was glad—glad!”

But in spite of Barney’s doctrine of bondage, Valancy thought  [valancy thought - валэнси мысль] they were splendidly free. [splendidly free - великолепно свободный]  It was amazing to be able to sit up half the night and look at the moon if you wanted to. To be late for meals if you wanted to—she who had always been rebuked so sharply by her mother and so reproachfully by Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат палочки] if she were one minute late. [one minute late - одна минута позже]  Dawdle over meals as long as you wanted to. Leave your crusts if you wanted to. Not come home  [come home - вернись домой] at all for meals if you wanted to. Sit on a sun-warm rock  [warm rock - теплый камень] and paddle your bare feet  [bare feet - босые ноги] in the hot sand  [hot sand - горячий песок] if you wanted to. Just sit and do nothing in the beautiful silence  [beautiful silence - прекрасная тишина] if you wanted to. In short, do any fool thing  [fool thing - дурачок] you wanted to whenever the notion took  [notion took - понятие взяло] you. If _that_ wasn’t freedom, what was?



 CHAPTER XXX [chapter xxx -  глава xxx] 

 They didn’t spend all their days on the island. They spent more than half of them wandering at will through the enchanted Muskoka country. [enchanted muskoka country - волшебная страна мускока]  Barney knew  [barney knew - барни знал] the woods as a book and he taught their lore and craft to Valancy. He could always find trail and haunt of the shy wood people. [shy wood people - застенчивые лесные люди]  Valancy learned  [valancy learned - валэнси узнала] the different fairy- [different fairy - разные феи] likenesses of the mosses—the charm and exquisiteness of woodland blossoms. [woodland blossoms - лесные цветы]  She learned to know every bird  [know every bird - знаю каждую птицу] at sight and mimic its call—though never so perfectly as Barney. She made friends  [made friends - подружились] with every kind  [every kind - все виды] of tree. She learned to paddle a canoe as well as Barney himself. She liked to be out in the rain and she never caught cold. [never caught cold - никогда не простужались] 

Sometimes they took a lunch with them and went berrying—strawberries and blueberries. How pretty blueberries  [pretty blueberries - красивая черника] were—the dainty green  [dainty green - лакомая зелень] of the unripe berries, [unripe berries - неспелые ягоды]  the glossy pinks  [glossy pinks - глянцевые гвоздики] and scarlets of the half ripes, [half ripes - полусозревшие]  the misty blue  [misty blue - туманная синева] of the fully matured! [fully matured - полностью созревшие]  And Valancy learned  [valancy learned - валентность узнала] the real flavour  [real flavour - настоящий аромат] of the strawberry in its highest perfection. [highest perfection - высшее совершенство]  There was a certain sunlit dell  [certain sunlit dell - некая залитая солнцем лощина] on the banks of Mistawis along  [mistawis along - миставис вдоль] which white birches grew  [white birches grew - выросли белые березы] on one side  [one side - одна сторона] and on the other still, changeless ranks  [changeless ranks - неизменные ряды] of young spruces. [young spruces - молодые ели]  There were long grasses  [long grasses - длинные травы] at the roots of the birches, combed down by the winds and wet with morning dew late  [morning dew late - утренняя роса поздно] into the afternoons. Here they found berries  [found berries - найденные ягоды] that might have graced the banquets of Lucullus, great ambrosial sweetnesses hanging like rubies to long, rosy stalks. [rosy stalks - розовые стебли]  They lifted them by the stalk and ate them from it, uncrushed and virgin, tasting each berry by itself with all its wild fragrance ensphered therein. When Valancy carried  [valancy carried - валентность перенесена] any of these berries home  [berries home - ягоды домашние] that elusive essence escaped  [elusive essence escaped - неуловимый эссенция ускользнула] and they became nothing  [became nothing - стали ничем] more than the common berries  [common berries - обычные ягоды] of the market-place—very kitchenly good indeed, [kitchenly good indeed - на кухне действительно хорошо]  but not as they would have been, eaten in their birch dell  [birch dell - березовая лощина] until her fingers were stained as pink as Aurora’s eyelids.

Or they went after water-lilies. Barney knew  [barney knew - барни знал] where to find them in the creeks and bays of Mistawis. Then the Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] was glorious with them, every receptacle  [every receptacle - каждое вместилище] that Valancy could contrive filled with the exquisite things. [exquisite things - изысканные вещи]  If not water lilies  [water lilies - кувшинки] then cardinal flowers, [cardinal flowers - кардинальные цветы]  fresh and vivid from the swamps of Mistawis, where they burned like ribbons  [burned like ribbons - сгорели, как ленты] of flame.

Or they just prowled and explored through woods that always seemed  [always seemed - всегда казалось] to be expecting something wonderful  [expecting something wonderful - ожидание чего-то чудесного] to happen. At least, that was the way Valancy felt  [way valancy felt - то, как чувствовала себя Валенси] about them. Down the next hollow—over the next hill—you would find  [would find - найдет] it.

“We don’t know where we’re going, but isn’t it fun to go?” Barney used to say.

Once or twice night overtook  [twice night overtook - дважды ночь настигала] them, too far from their Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] to get back. [get back - вернуться]  But Barney made  [barney made - сделано барни] a fragrant bed  [fragrant bed - ароматная постель] of bracken and fir boughs  [fir boughs - еловые ветки] and they slept on it dreamlessly, under a ceiling of old spruces  [old spruces - старые ели] with moss hanging  [moss hanging - висящий мох] from them, while beyond them moonlight and the murmur of pines blended together  [pines blended together - сосны смешались вместе] so that one could hardly tell which was light and which was sound.

There were rainy days, [rainy days - дождливые дни]  of course, when Muskoka was a wet green land. [wet green land - влажная зеленая земля]  Days when showers drifted across Mistawis like pale ghosts of rain and they never thought  [never thought - никогда не думал] of staying in because of it. Days when it rained in right good earnest  [right good earnest - верно, серьезно ] and they had to stay in. Then Barney shut  [barney shut - барни закрылся] himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber and Valancy read, [valancy read - вэланси читал]  or dreamed on the wolfskins with Good Luck purring beside her and Banjo watching  [banjo watching - смотрит банджо] them suspiciously from his own peculiar chair. [peculiar chair - необычный стул]  On Sunday evenings  [sunday evenings - воскресные вечера] they paddled across  [paddled across - переплыл] to a point of land and walked from there through the woods to the little Free Methodist church. One felt really  [one felt really - было ощущение, что действительно] too happy for Sunday. Valancy had never really liked Sundays before.

And always, Sundays and weekdays, she was with Barney. Nothing else really mattered. And what a companion he was! How understanding! How jolly! How—how Barney—like! That summed it all up.

Valancy had taken some of her two hundred dollars  [two hundred dollars - двести долларов] out of the bank and spent it in pretty clothes. [pretty clothes - красивую одежду]  She had a little smoke- [little smoke - немного дыма] blue chiffon  [blue chiffon - голубой шифон] which she always put  [always put - всегда положить] on when they spent the evening at home—smoke-blue with touches of silver about it. It was after she began wearing  [began wearing - начал носить] it that Barney began calling  [barney began calling - барни начал звонить] her Moonlight.

“Moonlight and blue twilight—that is what you look like  [look like - выглядеть] in that dress. I like it. It belongs to you. You aren’t exactly pretty, [exactly pretty - очень красиво]  but you have some adorable beauty- [adorable beauty - очаровательная красота] spots. Your eyes. And that little kissable dent  [little kissable dent - маленькая вмятина, привлекательная для поцелуев] just between your collar bones. [collar bones - воротничковые кости]  You have the wrist and ankle of an aristocrat. That little head  [little head - маленькая голова] of yours is beautifully shaped. [beautifully shaped - красивая форма]  And when you look backward  [look backward - оглядываться назад] over your shoulder you’re maddening—especially in twilight or moonlight. An elf maiden. [elf maiden - эльфийская дева]  A wood sprite. [wood sprite - деревянная фея]  You belong to the woods, Moonlight—you should never be out of them. In spite of your ancestry, there is something wild  [something wild - что-то дикое] and remote and untamed about you. And you have such a nice, sweet, throaty, summery voice. [summery voice - летний голос]  Such a nice voice  [nice voice - приятный голос] for love-making.”

“Shure an’ ye’ve kissed the Blarney Stone,” scoffed Valancy. But she tasted these compliments for weeks.

She got a pale green bathing- [pale green bathing - бледно-зеленое купание] suit, too—a garment which would have given her clan their deaths if they had ever seen  [ever seen - когда-либо видел] her in it. Barney taught  [barney taught - барни учил] her how to swim. Sometimes she put her bathing-dress on when she got up and didn’t take it off until she went to bed—running down to the water for a plunge whenever  [plunge whenever - окунаться всякий раз] she felt like  [felt like - чувствовал, что] it and sprawling on the sun-warm rocks  [warm rocks - теплые скалы] to dry.

She had forgotten all the old humiliating things  [old humiliating things - старые унизительные вещи] that used to come up against her in the night—the injustices and the disappointments. It was as if they had all happened to some other person—not to her, Valancy Snaith, [valancy snaith - валенси снайт]  who had always been happy.

“I understand now what it means to be born again,” she told Barney. [told barney - рассказал барни] 

Holmes speaks  [holmes speaks - холмс говорит] of grief “staining backward” through the pages of life; but Valancy found  [valancy found - валэнси найден] her happiness had stained backward likewise  [stained backward likewise - запятнанный назад точно так же] and flooded with rose-colour her whole previous drab existence. She found it hard to believe that she had ever been lonely and unhappy and afraid.

“When death comes, [death comes - смерть приходит]  I shall have lived,” thought Valancy. “I shall have had my hour.”

And her dust-pile!

One day Valancy  [one day valancy - однажды валэнси] had heaped up the sand in the little island cove  [little island cove - маленькая островная бухта] in a tremendous cone  [tremendous cone - огромный конус] and stuck a gay little Union Jack on top of it.

“What are you celebrating?” Barney wanted to know.

“I’m just exorcising an old demon,” Valancy told him.



 CHAPTER XXXI [chapter xxxi - глава xxxi] 

 Autumn came. [autumn came - наступила осень]  Late September  [late september - конец сентября] with cool nights. [cool nights - прохладные ночи]  They had to forsake the verandah; but they kindled a fire in the big fireplace  [big fireplace - большой камин] and sat before it with jest and laughter. They left the doors open, [doors open - двери открыты]  and Banjo and Good Luck came  [good luck came - пришла удача] and went at pleasure. Sometimes they sat gravely  [sat gravely - сидел серьезно] on the bearskin rug  [bearskin rug - ковер из медвежьей шкуры] between Barney and Valancy; sometimes they slunk off into the mystery of the chill night outside. [chill night outside - холодная ночь на улице]  The stars smouldered  [stars smouldered - звезды тлели] in the horizon mists  [horizon mists - туманы на горизонте] through the old oriel. [old oriel - старый эркер]  The haunting, persistent croon  [persistent croon - настойчивое напевание] of the pine-trees filled  [trees filled - деревья наполнились] the air. The little waves began  [little waves began - маленькие волны началась] to make soft, [make soft - сделай мягким]  sobbing splashes  [sobbing splashes - рыдающие брызги] on the rocks below them in the rising winds. [rising winds - поднимающийся ветер]  They needed no light but the firelight that sometimes leaped  [sometimes leaped - иногда вскакивала] up and revealed them—sometimes shrouded them in shadow. When the night wind rose higher Barney would shut the door and light a lamp and read to her—poetry and essays and gorgeous, dim chronicles  [dim chronicles - тусклые хроники] of ancient wars. [ancient wars - древние войны]  Barney never would read novels: he vowed they bored him. But sometimes she read them herself, curled up on the wolf skins, [wolf skins - волчьи шкуры]  laughing aloud  [laughing aloud - смех громко] in peace. For Barney was not one of those aggravating people  [aggravating people - отягчающие люди] who can never hear  [never hear - никогда не слышу] you smiling audibly  [smiling audibly - громко улыбался] over something you’ve read without inquiring placidly, “What is the joke?”

October—with a gorgeous pageant  [gorgeous pageant - великолепное зрелище] of color around Mistawis, [color around mistawis - цвет вокруг мистависа]  into which Valancy plunged  [valancy plunged - галантность погрузилась] her soul. Never had she imagined anything  [imagined anything - воображал что-нибудь] so splendid. A great, tinted peace. [tinted peace - подкрашенный покой]  Blue, wind-winnowed skies. [winnowed skies - проветренное небо]  Sunlight sleeping  [sunlight sleeping - солнечный сон] in the glades of that fairyland. Long dreamy purple days paddling idly in their canoe along shores  [canoe along shores - каноэ вдоль берегов] and up the rivers of crimson and gold. A sleepy, red hunter’s moon. Enchanted tempests  [enchanted tempests - заколдованные бури] that stripped the leaves from the trees and heaped them along the shores. Flying shadows  [flying shadows - летящие тени] of clouds. What had all the smug, opulent lands  [opulent lands - богатый земли] out front to compare with this?

November—with uncanny witchery  [uncanny witchery - жуткое колдовство] in its changed trees. [changed trees - измененные деревья]  With murky red sunsets flaming in smoky crimson behind  [smoky crimson behind - дымно-багровый позади] the westering hills. [westering hills - западные холмы]  With dear days  [dear days - дорогие дни] when the austere woods  [austere woods - суровый лес] were beautiful and gracious in a dignified serenity  [dignified serenity - достойная безмятежность] of folded hands  [folded hands - сложенные руки] and closed eyes—days full of a fine, pale sunshine  [pale sunshine - бледное солнце] that sifted through the late, leafless gold  [leafless gold - золото без листьев] of the juniper-trees and glimmered among  [glimmered among - мерцали среди] the grey beeches, [grey beeches - серые буки]  lighting up evergreen banks  [evergreen banks - вечнозеленые берега] of moss and washing the colonnades of the pines. Days with a high-sprung sky  [sprung sky - подпрыгивающее небо] of flawless turquoise. [flawless turquoise - безупречная бирюза]  Days when an exquisite melancholy seemed  [exquisite melancholy seemed - изысканная меланхолия казалась] to hang over the landscape and dream about the lake. But days, too, of the wild blackness  [wild blackness - дикой черноты] of great autumn storms, [great autumn storms - великие осенние бури]  followed by dank, wet, streaming nights  [streaming nights - текущие ночи] when there was witch-laughter in the pines and fitful moans among  [fitful moans among - судорожные стоны среди] the mainland trees. [mainland trees - деревья материка]  What cared they? Old Tom  [old tom - старый том] had built his roof well, [roof well - колодец на крыше ]  and his chimney drew. [chimney drew - труба дымохода] 

“Warm fire—books—comfort—safety from storm—our cats on the rug. Moonlight,” said Barney, “would you be any happier now if you had a million dollars?”

“No—nor half so happy. I’d be bored by conventions and obligations then.”

But now she loved winter. [loved winter - любимая зима]  Winter was beautiful “u [beautiful “ - красивый"] p back”—almost intolerably beautiful. Days of clear brilliance. [clear brilliance - ясный блеск]  Evenings that were like cups  [like cups - как чаши] of glamour—the purest vintage  [purest vintage - чистейший винтаж] of winter’s wine. Nights with their fire of stars. Cold, exquisite winter sunrises. [exquisite winter sunrises - изысканные зимние восходы]  Lovely ferns  [lovely ferns - милые папоротники] of ice all over the windows of the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  Moonlight on birches in a silver thaw. [silver thaw - серебристая оттепель]  Ragged shadows  [ragged shadows - рваные тени] on windy evenings—torn, twisted, fantastic shadows. [fantastic shadows - фантастические тени]  Great silences, [great silences - великая тишина]  austere and searching. Jewelled, barbaric hills. [barbaric hills - варварские холмы]  The sun suddenly breaking  [sun suddenly breaking - внезапно вспыхивающее солнце] through grey clouds  [grey clouds - серые облака] over long, white Mistawis. [white mistawis - белая манта]  Icy-grey twilights, [grey twilights - серые сумерки]  broken by snow-squalls, when their cosy living- [cosy living - уютная жизнь ] room, with its goblins of firelight and inscrutable cats seemed cosier than ever. Every hour brought  [every hour brought - каждый час принес] a new revelation  [new revelation - новое откровение] and wonder.

Barney ran Lady Jane into Roaring Abel’s barn and taught Valancy  [taught valancy - выучила валэнси] how to snowshoe—Valancy, who ought to be laid up with bronchitis. But Valancy had not even a cold. Later on in the winter Barney  [winter barney - зимний барни] had a terrible one  [terrible one - ужасный] and Valancy nursed  [valancy nursed - валэнси вскормила] him through it with a dread of pneumonia in her heart. But Valancy’s colds seemed  [colds seemed - холоды показались] to have gone where old moons go. [old moons go - старые луны идут]  Which was luck—for she hadn’t even Redfern’s Liniment. She had thoughtfully bought  [thoughtfully bought - задумчиво купил] a bottle at the Port and Barney had hurled it into frozen Mistawis  [frozen mistawis - замерзший миставис] with a scowl.

“Bring no more of that devilish stuff  [devilish stuff - дьявольская хрень] here,” he had ordered briefly. [ordered briefly - заказал коротко]  It was the first and last time  [last time - последний раз] he had spoken harshly  [spoken harshly - резко сказано] to her.

They went for long tramps  [long tramps - длинные бродяги] through the exquisite reticence  [exquisite reticence - изысканная сдержанность] of winter woods  [winter woods - зимний лес] and the silver jungles  [silver jungles - серебряные джунгли] of frosted trees, [frosted trees - замерзшие деревья]  and found loveliness everywhere. [found loveliness everywhere -  везде находил прелесть] 

At times they seemed to be walking through a spellbound world  [spellbound world - зачарованный мир] of crystal and pearl, so white and radiant were clearings and lakes and sky. The air was so crisp and clear that it was half intoxicating. [half intoxicating - полуопьяняющий] 

Once they stood in a hesitation of ecstasy at the entrance of a narrow path  [narrow path - узкая тропинка] between ranks of birches. Every twig  [every twig - каждая веточка] and spray was outlined in snow. The undergrowth along  [undergrowth along - подлесок вдоль] its sides was a little fairy forest cut out of marble. The shadows cast  [shadows cast - тени отбрасывают] by the pale sunshine  [pale sunshine - бледное солнце] were fine and spiritual.

“Come away,” said Barney, turning. “We must not commit the desecration of tramping through there.”

One evening  [one evening - однажды вечер] they came upon  [came upon - наткнулся на ] a snowdrift far back  [snowdrift far back - снежный сугроб вдали] in an old clearing  [old clearing - старая поляна] which was in the exact likeness  [exact likeness - точное сходство] of a beautiful woman’s profile. Seen too close by, the resemblance was lost, as in the fairy-tale of the Castle of St. John. Seen from behind, it was a shapeless oddity. [shapeless oddity - бесформенная странность]  But at just the right distance  [right distance - правильное расстояние] and angle the outline was so perfect that when they came suddenly upon  [came suddenly upon - наткнулся внезапно] it, gleaming out against the dark background  [dark background - темный фон] of spruce in the glow of that winter sunset  [winter sunset - зимний закат] they both exclaimed in amazement. There was a low, noble brow, [noble brow - благородный лоб]  a straight, classic nose, [classic nose - классический нос]  lips and chin and cheek-curve modelled  [curve modelled - кривая смоделирована] as if some goddess of old time  [old time - старое время] had sat to the sculptor, and a breast of such cold, swelling purity  [swelling purity - набухшая чистота] as the very spirit of the winter woods might display.

“‘All the beauty that old Greece  [old greece - старая греция] and Rome, sung painted, [sung painted - воспенная роспись]  taught,’” quoted Barney.

“And to think no human eyes save  [human eyes save - человеческие глаза спасают] ours have seen or will see it,” breathed Valancy, [,” breathed valancy - , – выдохнул valancy]  who felt at times as if she were living in a book by John Foster. [john foster - джон фостер]  As she looked around  [looked around - огляделся] her she recalled some passages she had marked in the new Foster book Barney had brought her from the Port—with an adjuration not to expect _him_ to read or listen to it.

“‘All the tintings of winter woods  [winter woods - зимний лес] are extremely delicate  [extremely delicate - чрезвычайно деликатный] and elusive,’” recalled Valancy. “‘When the brief afternoon wanes  [brief afternoon wanes - короткая послеобеденная убыль] and the sun just touches the tops of the hills, there seems to be all over the woods an abundance, not of colour, but of the spirit of colour. There is really nothing  [really nothing - на самом деле ничего] but pure white  [pure white - чистый белый] after all, but one has the impression of fairy-like blendings  [like blendings - как смешение] of rose and violet, opal and heliotrope on the slopes—in the dingles and along the curves of the forest-land. You feel sure  [feel sure - чувствую себя уверенным] the tint is there, but when you look at it directly it is gone. From the corner of your eye you are aware that it is lurking over yonder in a spot where there was nothing but pale purity  [pale purity - бледная чистота] a moment ago. [moment ago - минуту назад]  Only just when the sun is setting is there a fleeting moment  [fleeting moment - мимолетное мгновение] of real colour. [real colour - настоящий цвет]  Then the redness streams  [redness streams - потоки красноты] out over the snow and incarnadines the hills and rivers and smites the crest of the pines with flame. Just a few minutes of transfiguration and revelation—and it is gone.’”

“I wonder if John Foster ever spent a winter in Mistawis,” said Valancy.

“Not likely,” scoffed Barney. “People who write tosh like  [write tosh like - написать чепуху] that generally write  [generally write - в целом пиши] it in a warm house  [warm house - теплый дом] on some smug city street.”

“You are too hard on John Foster,” said Valancy severely. “No one could  [one could - можно] have written that little paragraph  [little paragraph - небольшой абзац] I read you last night without  [last night without - прошлой ночью без] having seen it first—you know he couldn’t.”

“I didn’t listen to it,” said Barney morosely. “You know I told you I wouldn’t.”

“Then you’ve got to listen to it now,” persisted Valancy. [,” persisted valancy - », упорная валентность]  She made him stand still  [stand still - стоять на месте] on his snowshoes while she repeated it.

“‘She is a rare artist, [rare artist -  редкий художник]  this old Mother Nature, [old mother nature - старая мать-природа]  who works “f [works “ - работает»] or the joy of working” and not in any spirit of vain show. [vain show - напрасное шоу]  Today the fir woods  [fir woods - еловый лес] are a symphony of greens and greys, so subtle that you cannot tell  [cannot tell - не могу сказать] where one shade begins  [one shade begins - один оттенок начинается] to be the other. Grey trunk, [grey trunk - серый ствол]  green bough, [green bough - зеленая ветвь]  grey-green moss  [green moss - зеленый мох] above the white, grey-shadowed floor. [shadowed floor - затененного пола]  Yet the old gypsy  [old gypsy - старый цыган] doesn’t like unrelieved monotones. [like unrelieved monotones - как безудержные монотоны]  She must have a dash of colour. See it. A broken dead fir bough, of a beautiful red- [beautiful red - красивый красный] brown, swinging among  [swinging among - качается среди] the beards of moss.’”

“Good Lord, do you learn all that fellow’s books by heart?” was Barney’s disgusted reaction  [disgusted reaction - реакция отвращения] as he strode off.

“John Foster’s books were all that saved my soul alive  [soul alive - живая душа] the past five years,” averred Valancy. “Oh, Barney, look at that exquisite filigree  [exquisite filigree - изысканная филигрань] of snow in the furrows of that old elm- [old elm - старый вяз] tree trunk.”

When they came out to the lake they changed from snowshoes to skates and skated home. [skated home - дом на коньках]  For a wonder Valancy  [wonder valancy - чудо valancy] had learned, when she was a little schoolgirl, [little schoolgirl - маленькая школьница]  to skate on the pond behind  [pond behind - пруд позади] the Deerwood school. [deerwood school - школа дирвуда]  She never had any skates of her own, but some of the other girls had lent her theirs and she seemed to have a natural knack  [natural knack - природная ловкость] of it. Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] had once promised her a pair of skates for Christmas, but when Christmas came  [christmas came - пришло рождество] he had given her rubbers instead. [rubbers instead - вместо резины]  She had never skated since  [never skated since - с тех пор никогда не катался на коньках] she grew up, but the old trick came back quickly, and glorious were the hours she and Barney spent skimming  [barney spent skimming - барни скользил по поверхности] over the white lakes  [white lakes - белые озера] and past the dark islands  [dark islands - темные острова] where the summer cottages  [summer cottages - летние коттеджи] were closed and silent. Tonight they flew down Mistawis before the wind, in an exhilaration that crimsoned Valancy’s cheeks under her white tam. [white tam - белый там]  And at the end was her dear little house, [dear little house - милый домик]  on the island of pines, with a coating of snow on its roof, sparkling in the moonlight. Its windows glinted impishly  [windows glinted impishly - окна озорно блеснули] at her in the stay gleams. [stay gleams - останьтесь блестками] 

“Looks exactly like a picture-book, doesn’t it?” said Barney.

“A land that can produce a goose like  [goose like - гусиный] that is an admirable land,” vowed Barney. “Canada forever!” And they drank to the Union Jack  [union jack - юнион джек] a bottle of dandelion wine  [dandelion wine - вино из одуванчиков] that Cousin Georgiana  [cousin georgiana - двоюродный брат Джорджиана] had given Valancy along  [given valancy along - дал валанс вместе] with the bedspread.

“One never knows,” Cousin Georgiana had said solemnly, [said solemnly - торжественно сказал]  “when one may need  [one may need - может понадобиться] a little stimulant.”

Barney had asked Valancy  [asked valancy - попросил валентность] what she wanted for a Christmas present. [christmas present - рождественский подарок] 

“Something frivolous and unnecessary,” said Valancy, who had got a pair of goloshes last Christmas  [goloshes last christmas - галоши на прошлое рождество] and two long- [two long - две длинные] sleeved, woolen undervests  [woolen undervests - шерстяные нижние жилеты] the year before. And so on back.

To her delight, Barney gave  [barney gave - барни дал] her a necklace of pearl beads. [pearl beads - жемчужные бусы]  Valancy had wanted a string of milky pearl beads—like congealed moonshine—all her life. And these were so pretty. All that worried her was that they were really too good. They must have cost a great deal—fifteen dollars, at least. Could Barney afford  [could barney afford - мог бы Барни позволить себе] that? She didn’t know a thing about his finances. She had refused to let him buy any of her clothes—she had enough for that, she told him, as long as she would need clothes. [would need clothes - нужна бы одежда ]  In a round, black jar  [black jar - черная банка] on the chimney-piece Barney put money for their household expenses—always enough. The jar was never empty, [never empty - никогда не пустовать]  though Valancy never caught him replenishing it. He couldn’t have much, of course, and that necklace—but Valancy tossed care aside. She would wear  [would wear - будет носить] it and enjoy it. It was the first pretty thing  [first pretty thing - первая красивая вещь] she had ever had.



 CHAPTER XXXII [chapter xxxii - глава xxxii] 

 New Year. [new year - новый год]  The old, shabby, inglorious outlived calendar came down. The new one went  [new one went - новый пошел] up. January was a month of storms. It snowed for three weeks  [three weeks - три недели] on end. The thermometer went miles  [thermometer went miles - термометр прошел мили] below zero and stayed there. But, as Barney and Valancy pointed  [valancy pointed - валанси заостренный] out to each other, there were no mosquitoes. And the roar and crackle of their big fire drowned  [big fire drowned - большой огонь утонул] the howls of the north wind. [north wind - северный ветер]  Good Luck  [good luck - удачи] and Banjo waxed fat  [banjo waxed fat - банджо натерто жиром] and developed resplendent coats  [developed resplendent coats - развились великолепные пальто] of thick, silky fur. [silky fur - шелковистый мех ]  Nip and Tuck had gone.

“But they’ll come back  [come back - вернись] in spring,” promised Barney.

There was no monotony. Sometimes they had dramatic little private spats that never even thought  [never even thought - даже не думал] of becoming quarrels. [becoming quarrels - становиться ссорами]  Sometimes Roaring Abel dropped in—for an evening or a whole day—with his old tartan cap  [old tartan cap - старая клетчатая кепка] and his long red beard coated with snow. He generally brought  [generally brought - вообще принес] his fiddle and played for them, to the delight of all except Banjo, [except banjo -  кроме банджо]  who would go temporarily insane and retreat under Valancy’s bed. Sometimes Abel  [sometimes abel - иногда абель] and Barney talked  [barney talked - барни разговаривал] while Valancy made candy  [valancy made candy - валанси делал конфеты] for them; sometimes they sat and smoked in silence _à la_ Tennyson and Carlyle, until the Blue Castle reeked  [blue castle reeked - голубой замок вонял] and Valancy fled  [valancy fled - валанси сбегал] to the open. Sometimes they played checkers fiercely  [played checkers fiercely - яростно играл в шашки] and silently the whole night  [whole night - целую ночь] through. Sometimes they all ate the russet apples Abel  [russet apples abel - красноватые яблоки авель] had brought, while the jolly old clock ticked the delightful minutes away. [delightful minutes away - прекрасные минуты пути] 

“A plate of apples, an open fire, [open fire - открытый огонь]  and ‘a jolly goode booke whereon to looke’ are a fair substitute  [fair substitute - честная замена] for heaven,” vowed Barney. “Any one can have the streets of gold. Let’s have another whack  [another whack - еще один удар] at Carman.”

It was easier now for the Stirlings to believe Valancy  [believe valancy -  верю вэлэнси] of the dead. Not even dim rumours  [even dim rumours - даже смутные слухи] of her having been over at the Port came  [port came - порт не пришел] to trouble them, though she and Barney used  [barney used - барни использовал] to skate there occasionally to see a movie and eat hot dogs shamelessly at the corner stand afterwards. [corner stand afterwards - после этого стоит в углу]  Presumably none  [presumably none - по-видимому, никто] of the Stirlings ever thought  [stirlings ever thought - стирлинги когда-либо думали] about her—except Cousin Georgiana, who used to lie awake worrying  [lie awake worrying - лежать без сна, беспокоясь] about poor Doss. [poor doss - бедняжка]  Did she have enough to eat? Was that dreadful creature good  [dreadful creature good - ужасная тварь хорошая] to her? Was she warm enough  [warm enough - достаточно тепло] at nights?

Valancy was quite warm  [quite warm - довольно тепло] at nights. She used to wake up and revel silently  [revel silently - упиваюсь молча] in the cosiness of those winter nights  [winter nights - зимние ночи] on that little island  [little island - маленький остров] in the frozen lake. [frozen lake - замерзший озеро]  The nights of other winters had been so cold and long. Valancy hated  [valancy hated - валэнси ненавидела] to wake up in them and think about the bleakness and emptiness of the day that had passed and the bleakness and emptiness of the day that would come. [would come - придет]  Now, she almost counted  [almost counted - почти сосчитало] that night lost  [night lost - ночь потеряна] on which she didn’t wake up and lie awake  [lie awake - лежать без сна] for half an hour just being happy, while Barney’s regular breathing went  [regular breathing went - обычное дыхание ушло] on beside her, and through the open door  [open door - открытая дверь] the smouldering brands  [smouldering brands - тлеющие бренды] in the fireplace winked  [fireplace winked - камин подмигнул] at her in the gloom. It was very nice to feel a little Lucky cat jump up on your bed in the darkness and snuggle down at your feet, purring; but Banjo would  [banjo would - банджо] be sitting dourly  [sitting dourly - сижу угрюмо] by himself out in front of the fire like  [fire like - огонь, как] a brooding demon. [brooding demon - задумчивый демон]  At such moments Banjo  [moments banjo - моменты банджо] was anything but canny, but Valancy loved  [valancy loved - валэнси любила] his uncanniness.

The side of the bed had to be right against the window. There was no other place for it in the tiny room. [tiny room - крохотная комната]  Valancy, lying there, could look  [could look - мог смотреть] out of the window, through the big pine boughs  [big pine boughs - большие сосновые ветки] that actually touched  [actually touched - на самом деле тронул] it, away up Mistawis, white and lustrous as a pavement of pearl, or dark and terrible in the storm. Sometimes the pine boughs tapped  [pine boughs tapped - стучали сосновые ветки] against the panes with friendly signals. [friendly signals - дружеские сигналы]  Sometimes she heard the little hissing whisper  [little hissing whisper - тихий шипящий шепот] of snow against them right at her side. Some nights the whole outer world seemed given over to the empery of silence; then came nights  [came nights - наступили ночи] when there would be a majestic sweep  [majestic sweep - величественный взмах] of wind in the pines; nights of dear starlight  [dear starlight - дорогой звездный свет] when it whistled freakishly  [whistled freakishly - причудливо свистнул] and joyously around  [joyously around - радостно вокруг ] the Blue Castle; [blue castle - голубой замок]  brooding nights  [brooding nights - задумчивые ночи] before storm when it crept along  [crept along - подкрался] the floor of the lake with a low, wailing cry  [wailing cry - плачущий крик] of boding and mystery. Valancy wasted many perfectly good sleeping hours in these delightful communings. [delightful communings - восхитительное общение]  But she could sleep  [could sleep - мог спать] as long in the morning as she wanted to. Nobody cared. [nobody cared - никто не заботился]  Barney cooked  [barney cooked - барни приготовил] his own breakfast of bacon and eggs and then shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber till supper time. Then they had an evening of reading and talk. They talked about everything in this world and a good many things  [good many things - много всего] in other worlds. They laughed over their own jokes until the Blue Castles  [blue castles - голубые замки] re-echoed.

“You _do_ laugh beautifully,” Barney told her once. “It makes me want to laugh just to hear you laugh. There’s a trick about your laugh—as if there were so much more fun back  [fun back - весело назад] of it that you wouldn’t let out. Did you laugh like  [laugh like - смеялся как] that before you came to Mistawis, Moonlight?”

“I never laughed  [never laughed - никогда не смеялся] at all—really. I used to giggle foolishly  [giggle foolishly - глупо хихикать] when I felt I was expected to. But now—the laugh just comes.”

It struck Valancy  [struck valancy - поразил валентность] more than once that Barney himself laughed a great deal oftener  [great deal oftener - гораздо чаще] than he used to and that his laugh had changed. It had become wholesome. [become wholesome - стать здоровым]  She rarely heard  [rarely heard - редко слышно] the little cynical note  [little cynical note - небольшое циничное примечание] in it now. Could a man laugh like  [man laugh like - мужской смех как] that who had crimes on his conscience? Yet Barney _must_ have done something. [done something - что-то сделал]  Valancy had indifferently made  [indifferently made - безразлично сделано] up her mind as to what he had done. She concluded he was a defaulting bank cashier. [defaulting bank cashier - неплательщик кассира банка]  She had found in one of Barney’s books an old clipping cut  [old clipping cut - старый вырезка] from a Montreal paper  [montreal paper - монреальская газета] in which a vanished, defaulting cashier  [defaulting cashier - неплательщик кассира] was described. The description applied  [description applied - описание применено] to Barney—as well as to half a dozen other men Valancy knew—and from some casual remarks  [casual remarks - случайные замечания] he had dropped from time to time she concluded he knew Montreal rather well. Valancy had it all figured out in the back of her mind. Barney had been in a bank. He was tempted to take some money to speculate—meaning, of course, to put it back. He had got in deeper and deeper, until he found there was nothing for it but flight. It had happened so to scores of men. He had, Valancy was absolutely certain, [absolutely certain - абсолютно уверен]  never meant  [never meant - никогда не имел в виду] to do wrong. Of course, the name of the man in the clipping was Bernard Craig. [bernard craig -  бернард крейг]  But Valancy had always thought Snaith  [always thought snaith - всегда думал, что snaith] was an alias. Not that it mattered.

“Barney, I thought you were dead,” she whispered.

Barney hooted. [barney hooted - барни ухнул] 

“After two years  [two years - два года] of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like  [baby storm like - детская буря, как] this could get  [could get - может стать] me? I spent the night in that old lumber shanty  [old lumber shanty - старая лачуга] over by Muskoka. A bit cold  [bit cold - немного холодно] but snug enough. [snug enough - достаточно уютно]  Little goose! [little goose - маленький гусь]  Your eyes look like burnt holes in a blanket. Did you sit up here all night worrying  [night worrying - ночное беспокойство] over an old woodsman like  [old woodsman like - старый лесоруб, как] me?”

“Yes,” said Valancy. “I—couldn’t help it. The storm seemed  [storm seemed - буря казалась] so wild. Anybody might  [anybody might - кто-то может] have been lost in it. When—I saw you—come round the point—there—something happened to me. I don’t know what. It was as if I had died and come back  [come back - вернись] to life. I can’t describe it any other way.”



 CHAPTER XXXIII [chapter xxxiii - глава xxxiii] 

 Spring. Mistawis black  [mistawis black - черный миставис] and sullen for a week or two, then flaming in sapphire and turquoise, lilac and rose again, laughing through the oriel, caressing its amethyst islands, [amethyst islands - аметистовые острова]  rippling under winds soft  [winds soft - ветер мягкий] as silk. Frogs, little green wizards  [little green wizards - маленькие зеленые волшебники] of swamp and pool, singing everywhere  [singing everywhere - поют повсюду] in the long twilights  [long twilights - долгие сумерки] and long into the nights; islands fairy- [islands fairy - острова феи] like in a green haze; [green haze - зеленая дымка]  the evanescent beauty  [evanescent beauty - мимолетная красота] of wild young trees  [wild young trees - дикие молодые деревья] in early leaf; [early leaf - ранний лист]  frost-like loveliness  [like loveliness - как прелесть] of the new foliage  [new foliage - новая листва] of juniper-trees; the woods putting  [woods putting - леса кладут] on a fashion of spring flowers, [spring flowers - весенние цветы]  dainty, spiritual things akin  [spiritual things akin - духовный родственные вещи] to the soul of the wilderness; red mist  [red mist - красный туман] on the maples; willows decked  [willows decked - ивы украшены] out with glossy silver pussies; [glossy silver pussies - глянцевые серебряные киски]  all the forgotten violets  [forgotten violets -  забытые фиалки] of Mistawis blooming  [mistawis blooming - цветение мистависа] again; lure of April moons. [april moons - апрельские луны] 

“Think how many thousands  [many thousands - многие тысячи] of springs have been here on Mistawis—and all of them beautiful,” said Valancy. “Oh, Barney, look at that wild plum! [wild plum - дикая слива]  I will—I must quote  [must quote - должны цитировать] from John Foster. [john foster - джон фостер]  There’s a passage in one of his books—I’ve re-read it a hundred times. [hundred times - сотни раз]  He must have written it before a tree just like that:

“‘Behold the young wild plum- [young wild plum - молодая дикая слива] tree which has adorned herself after immemorial fashion  [immemorial fashion -  незапамятная мода] in a wedding-veil of fine lace. [fine lace - тонкие кружева]  The fingers of wood pixies must  [wood pixies must - лесные пикси должны] have woven it, for nothing like  [nothing like - ничего похожего] it ever came  [ever came - когда-либо приходила] from an earthly loom. [earthly loom - земной ткацкий станок]  I vow the tree is conscious of its loveliness. It is bridling before our very eyes—as if its beauty were not the most ephemeral thing  [ephemeral thing - эфемерная вещь] in the woods, as it is the rarest and most exceeding, for today it is and tomorrow it is not. Every south wind purring through the boughs will winnow away  [winnow away - отвеять] a shower of slender petals. [slender petals - тонкие лепестки]  But what matter? Today it is queen of the wild places  [wild places - дикие места] and it is always today  [always today - всегда сегодня] in the woods.’”

“I’m sure you feel much better since you’ve got that out of your system,” said Barney heartlessly.

“Here’s a patch of dandelions,” said Valancy, unsubdued. “Dandelions shouldn’t grow in the woods, though. They haven’t any sense of the fitness of things at all. They are too cheerful and self-satisfied. They haven’t any of the mystery and reserve of the real wood- [real wood - настоящее дерево] flowers.”

“In short, they’ve no secrets,” said Barney. “But wait a bit. The woods will have their own way even  [way even - путь даже] with those obvious dandelions. [obvious dandelions - очевидные одуванчики]  In a little while all that obtrusive yellowness  [obtrusive yellowness - навязчивая желтизна] and complacency will be gone and we’ll find here misty, phantom-like globes hovering  [like globes hovering - словно парящие шары] over those long grasses  [long grasses - длинные травы] in full harmony  [full harmony - полная гармония] with the traditions of the forest.”

“That sounds John Fosterish,” teased Valancy.

“What have I done that deserved a slam like  [slam like - хлопок как] that?” complained Barney.

One of the earliest signs  [earliest signs - самые ранние признаки] of spring was the renaissance of Lady Jane. [lady jane - леди джейн]  Barney put  [barney put - барни положил] her on roads that no other car would look  [car would look - машина выглядела] at, and they went through Deerwood in mud to the axles. They passed several Stirlings, [passed several stirlings - проехал несколько стирлингов]  who groaned and reflected that now spring was come they would encounter  [would encounter - столкнулся бы] that shameless pair everywhere. [shameless pair everywhere - бесстыдная пара повсюду ]  Valancy, prowling about Deerwood shops, [deerwood shops - дирвуд магазины]  met Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя Бенджамин]  [met uncle benjamin - встретил дядю Бенджамина] on the street; but he did not realise until he had gone two blocks  [gone two blocks - прошел два квартала] further on that the girl in the scarlet-collared blanket coat, [collared blanket coat - пальто-одеяло с воротником]  with cheeks reddened  [cheeks reddened - щеки покраснели] in the sharp April air  [sharp april air - резкий апрельский воздух] and the fringe of black hair  [black hair - черные волосы] over laughing, slanted eyes, [slanted eyes - раскосые глаза]  was Valancy. When he did realise it, Uncle Benjamin was indignant. What business had Valancy to look like— [look like - похож на] like—like a young girl? [young girl - молодая девушка]  The way of the transgressor was hard. Had to be. Scriptural and proper. Yet Valancy’s path couldn’t be hard. She wouldn’t look like that if it were. There was something wrong. [something wrong - что-то не так]  It was almost enough  [almost enough - почти достаточно] to make a man turn modernist. [man turn modernist - мужчина превратился в модерниста] 

Barney and Valancy clanged  [valancy clanged - валенси звенела] on to the Port, so that it was dark when they went through Deerwood again. At her old home Valancy, [old home valancy - старая домашняя валенси]  seized with a sudden impulse, [sudden impulse - внезапный порыв]  got out, opened the little gate  [little gate - маленькие ворота] and tiptoed around  [tiptoed around - на цыпочках вокруг] to the sitting-room window. [room window - окно комнаты]  There sat her mother and Cousin Stickles drearily, [cousin stickles drearily - кузен уныло цепляется]  grimly knitting. [grimly knitting - угрюмо вязала]  Baffling and inhuman as ever. If they had looked the least bit lonesome Valancy would  [valancy would - валенси бы] have gone in. But they did not. Valancy would not disturb them for worlds.



 CHAPTER XXXIV [chapter xxxiv - глава xxxiv] 

 Valancy had two wonderful moments  [two wonderful moments - два чудесных момента] that spring.

One day, [one day - однажды]  coming home  [coming home - возвращение домой] through the woods, with her arms full  [arms full - руки полны] of trailing arbutus  [trailing arbutus - свисающие земляничные деревья] and creeping spruce, [creeping spruce - ползучие ели]  she met a man who she knew must  [knew must - знал, что нужно] be Allan Tierney. [allan tierney - аллан тирни]  Allan Tierney, the celebrated painter  [celebrated painter - известный художник] of beautiful women. [beautiful women - красивые женщины]  He lived in New York  [new york - нью-йорк] in winter, but he owned an island cottage  [island cottage - островной коттедж] at the northern end  [northern end - северный конец] of Mistawis to which he always came  [always came - всегда приходил] the minute the ice was out of the lake. He was reputed to be a lonely, eccentric man. [eccentric man - эксцентричный мужчина]  He never flattered  [never flattered - никогда не льстила] his sitters. There was no need to, for he would not paint any one who required flattery. [required flattery - требуется лесть]  To be painted by Allan Tierney was all the _cachet_ of beauty a woman could desire. [woman could desire -  женщина могла желать]  Valancy had heard so much about him that she couldn’t help turning  [help turning - помочь повернуться] her head back  [head back - голова назад] over her shoulder for another shy, [another shy - еще один застенчивый]  curious look  [curious look - любопытный взгляд] at him. A shaft of pale spring sunlight fell through a great pine athwart  [great pine athwart - великая сосна поперек] her bare black head  [bare black head - голая черная голова] and her slanted eyes. [slanted eyes - раскосые глаза]  She wore a pale green sweater  [pale green sweater - бледно-зеленый свитер] and had bound a fillet of linnæa vine  [linnæa vine -  linnæa vine] about her hair. The feathery fountain  [feathery fountain - перистый фонтан] of trailing spruce overflowed  [trailing spruce overflowed - свисающие ели переполнены] her arms and fell around  [fell around - упал вокруг] her. Allan Tierney’s eyes lighted  [eyes lighted - глаза загорелись] up.

“I’ve had a caller,” said Barney the next afternoon, [next afternoon - следующий полдень]  when Valancy had returned from another flower quest. [another flower quest - еще один цветочный квест] 

“Who?” Valancy was surprised but indifferent. She began filling  [began filling - начал наполняться] a basket with arbutus.

“Allan Tierney. He wants to paint you, Moonlight.”

“Me!” Valancy dropped her basket and her arbutus. “You’re laughing at me, Barney.”

“Beautiful women,” finished Barney. “Conceded. Q. E. D., Mistress Barney Snaith is a beautiful woman.”

“Nonsense,” said Valancy, stooping to retrieve her arbutus. “You _know_ that’s nonsense, Barney. I know I’m a heap better- [heap better - намного лучше] looking than I was a year ago, [year ago - год назад]  but I’m not beautiful.”

“Allan Tierney never makes a mistake,” said Barney. “You forget, Moonlight, that there are different kinds  [different kinds - разные виды] of beauty. Your imagination is obsessed by the very obvious type  [obvious type - очевидный тип] of your cousin Olive. [cousin olive - двоюродная сестра оливка]  Oh, I’ve seen her—she’s a stunner—but you’d never catch Allan Tierney wanting to paint her. In the horrible but expressive slang phrase, [expressive slang phrase - выразительная сленговая фраза]  she keeps all her goods in the shop-window. But in your subconscious mind  [subconscious mind - подсознание] you have a conviction that nobody can be beautiful who doesn’t look like Olive. [look like olive - похож на оливку]  Also, you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was not allowed to shine through it. Tierney said something  [tierney said something - тьерни что-то сказал] about the curve of your cheek as you looked back  [looked back - оглядывался назад] over your shoulder. You know I’ve often told  [often told - часто говорит] you it was distracting. And he’s quite batty  [quite batty - довольно сумасшедший] about your eyes. If I wasn’t absolutely sure  [absolutely sure - абсолютно уверен] it was solely professional—he’s really a crabbed old bachelor, [crabbed old bachelor - раздраженный старый холостяк]  you know—I’d be jealous.”

“Well, I don’t want to be painted,” said Valancy. “I hope you told him that.”

“I couldn’t tell him that. I didn’t know what _you_ wanted. But I told him _I_ didn’t want my wife painted—hung up in a salon for the mob to stare at. Belonging to another man. [another man - другой мужчина]  For of course I couldn’t buy the picture. So even if you had wanted to be painted, Moonlight, your tyrannous husband would  [tyrannous husband would - тиранический муж] not have permitted it. Tierney was a bit squiffy. [bit squiffy -  немного скряга]  He isn’t used to being turned down like that. His requests are almost like royalty’s.”

“But we are outlaws,” laughed Valancy. “We bow to no decrees—we acknowledge no sovereignty.”

In her heart she thought unashamedly: [thought unashamedly - незастенчиво подумал] 

“I wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted  [allan tierney wanted - аллан тирни хотел] to paint me. _Me_! Little-old-maid-Valancy-Stirling-that-was.”

Her second wonder- [second wonder - второе чудо] moment came one evening in May. She realised that Barney actually liked  [barney actually liked - барни на самом деле нравился] her. She had always hoped  [always hoped - всегда надеялся] he did, but sometimes she had a little, disagreeable, haunting dread  [haunting dread - преследующий страх] that he was just kind and nice and chummy out of pity; knowing that she hadn’t long to live and determined she should have a good time  [good time - хорошее время] as long as she did live; but away back  [away back - назад] in his mind rather looking forward to freedom again, with no intrusive woman creature  [intrusive woman creature - навязчивая женщина-существо] in his island fastness  [island fastness - островная крепость] and no chattering thing beside  [chattering thing beside - болтовня рядом] him in his woodland prowls. [woodland prowls - лесные прогулки]  She knew he could never love  [could never love - никогда не мог любить] her. She did not even want  [even want - даже хочу] him to. If he loved her he would be unhappy when she died—Valancy never flinched from the plain word. [plain word - простое слово]  No “passing away” for her. And she did not want him to be the least unhappy. [least unhappy - наименее несчастный]  But neither did she want him to be glad—or relieved. She wanted him to like her and miss her as a good chum. [good chum -  хороший приятель]  But she had never been sure until this night that he did.

They had walked over the hills in the sunset. They had the delight of discovering a virgin spring  [virgin spring - девственная весна] in a ferny hollow  [ferny hollow - папоротниковая лощина] and had drunk together  [drunk together - выпили вместе] from it out of a birch-bark cup; [bark cup - чашка из коры]  they had come to an old tumble- [old tumble - старый перевал] down rail fence  [rail fence - рельсовый забор] and sat on it for a long time. [long time - долгое время]  They didn’t talk much, [talk much - много говорить]  but Valancy had a curious sense  [curious sense - любопытный смысл] of _oneness_. She knew that she couldn’t have felt that if he hadn’t liked her.

“You nice little thing, [nice little thing - милая штучка] ” said Barney suddenly. “Oh, you nice little thing! Sometimes I feel you’re too nice to be real—that I’m just dreaming you.”

“Why can’t I die now—this very minute—when I am so happy!” thought Valancy.

Well, it couldn’t be so very long now. Somehow, Valancy had always felt  [always felt - всегда чувствовал] she would live  [would live -  прожил бы] out the year Dr. [year dr - год доктор]  Trent had allotted. She had not been careful—she had never tried  [never tried - никогда не пытался] to be. But, somehow, she had always counted  [always counted - всегда считалось] on living out her year. She had not let herself think about it at all. But now, sitting here beside Barney, [beside barney - рядом с барни]  with her hand in his, a sudden realisation came  [sudden realisation came - внезапно пришло осознание] to her. She had not had a heart attack  [heart attack - сердечный приступ] for a long while—two months at least. The last one  [last one - последний] she had had was two or three nights  [three nights - три ночи] before Barney was out in the storm. Since then she had not remembered she had a heart. Well, no doubt, it betokened the nearness of the end. Nature had given up the struggle. There would be no more pain.

“I’m afraid heaven  [afraid heaven - боюсь небес] will be very dull after this past year,” thought Valancy. “But perhaps one  [perhaps one - возможно, один] will not remember. Would that be—nice? No, no. I don’t want to forget Barney. [forget barney - забудь барни]  I’d rather be miserable in heaven remembering  [heaven remembering - небеса вспоминали] him than happy forgetting  [happy forgetting - счастливо забываю] him. And I’ll always remember  [always remember - всегда помни] through all eternity—that he really, _really_ liked me.”



 CHAPTER XXXV [chapter xxxv - глава xxxv] 

 Thirty seconds  [thirty seconds - тридцать секунд ] can be very long sometimes. [long sometimes - долго иногда]  Long enough  [long enough - достаточно долго] to work a miracle or a revolution. In thirty seconds life changed wholly for Barney and Valancy Snaith. [valancy snaith - валэнси снайт] 

They had gone around  [gone around - обошел] the lake one June evening in their disappearing propeller, [disappearing propeller - исчезающий пропеллер]  fished for an hour in a little creek, [little creek - маленький ручей]  left their boat there, and walked up through the woods to Port Lawrence two miles away. Valancy prowled  [valancy prowled - валанси рыскал] a bit in the shops and got herself a new pair  [new pair - новая пара] of sensible shoes. [sensible shoes - разумные туфли]  Her old pair  [old pair - старая пара] had suddenly and completely given  [completely given - полностью дан] out, and this evening she had been compelled to put on the little fancy pair  [little fancy pair - маленькую причудливую пару] of patent-leather with rather high, [rather high - довольно высокие]  slender heels, [slender heels - тонкие каблуки]  which she had bought in a fit of folly one day  [folly one day - глупость в один прекрасный день] in the winter because of their beauty and because she wanted to make one foolish, [make one foolish - сделать одну глупую]  extravagant purchase  [extravagant purchase - экстравагантная покупка] in her life. She sometimes put  [sometimes put - иногда надевать] them on of an evening in the Blue Castle, [blue castle - голубой замок]  but this was the first time  [first time - первый раз] she had worn them outside. She had not found it any too easy walking  [easy walking - легкая прогулка] up through the woods in them, and Barney guyed  [barney guyed - барни натянул] her unmercifully about them. But in spite of the inconvenience, Valancy secretly rather liked the look of her trim ankles  [trim ankles - подрезать лодыжки] and high instep  [high instep - высокие подъем] above those pretty, foolish shoes  [foolish shoes - дурацкие туфли] and did not change them in the shop as she might have done.

The sun was hanging low  [hanging low -  висит низко] above the pines when they left Port Lawrence. [port lawrence - порт-лоуренс]  [left port lawrence - покинул порт-лоуренс]  To the north of it the woods closed around  [woods closed around - лес вокруг сомкнулся] the town quite suddenly. [town quite suddenly - город совершенно внезапно]  Valancy always  [valancy always - валэнси всегда] had a sense of stepping from one world  [one world - один мир] to another—from reality to fairyland—when she went out of Port Lawrence and in a twinkling found  [twinkling found - мерцание найдено] it shut off behind her by the armies of the pines.

A mile and a half from Port Lawrence  [port lawrence - порт-лоуренс] there was a small railroad station  [small railroad station - маленькая железнодорожная станция] with a little station- [little station - маленькая станция] house which at this hour of the day was deserted, since no local train  [local train -  местный поезд] was due. Not a soul was in sight when Barney and Valancy emerged  [valancy emerged - появилась валентность] from the woods. Off to the left a sudden curve  [sudden curve - внезапный поворот] in the track hid  [track hid - путь скрылся] it from view, but over the tree-tops beyond, [tops beyond - вершины за пределами]  the long plume  [long plume - длинный шлейф] of smoke betokened  [smoke betokened - дым предвещал] the approach of a through train. The rails were vibrating to its thunder as Barney stepped across  [barney stepped across - барни перешагнул] the switch. Valancy was a few steps behind  [steps behind - шаги позади] him, loitering to gather June- [gather june - собери июнь] bells along  [bells along - звонки вдоль] the little, winding path. [winding path - извилистый путь]  But there was plenty of time to get across  [get across - преодолеть] before the train came. [train came - пришел поезд]  She stepped unconcernedly  [stepped unconcernedly - беспечно ступил] over the first rail. [first rail - первый рельс] 

She could never tell  [could never tell - никогда не могу сказать] how it happened. The ensuing thirty seconds always seemed in her recollection like  [recollection like - воспоминание как] a chaotic nightmare  [chaotic nightmare - хаотический кошмар] in which she endured the agony of a thousand lifetimes. [thousand lifetimes - тысячи жизней] 

The heel of her pretty, foolish shoe caught  [foolish shoe caught - дурацкий ботинок пойман] in a crevice of the switch. She could not pull it loose.

“Barney—Barney!” she called in alarm.

Barney turned—saw her predicament—saw her ashen face—dashed back. He tried to pull her clear—he tried to wrench her foot from the prisoning hold. [prisoning hold - заключение в тюрьму]  In vain. In a moment the train would sweep around the curve—would be on them.

“Go—go—quick—you’ll be killed, Barney!” shrieked Valancy, trying to push him away.

Barney dropped  [barney dropped - барни упал] on his knees, ghost-white, frantically tearing  [frantically tearing - неистово рвется] at her shoe-lace. The knot defied  [knot defied - узлу бросил вызов] his trembling fingers. [trembling fingers - дрожащие пальцы]  He snatched a knife from his pocket and slashed at it. Valancy still strove blindly to push him away. Her mind was full of the hideous thought  [hideous thought - отвратительная мысль] that Barney was going to be killed. She had no thought for her own danger.

“Barney—go—go—for God’s sake—go!”

“Thank God!” he breathed.

For a moment they stood stupidly staring  [stood stupidly staring - стоял и тупо смотрел] at each other, two white, [two white - два белых]  shaken, wild-eyed creatures. [eyed creatures - глазастые существа]  Then they stumbled over to the little seat  [little seat - маленькое сиденье] at the end of the station-house and dropped on it. Barney buried  [barney buried - барни погребен] his face in his hands and said not a word. Valancy sat, [valancy sat - валанси сидел]  staring straight ahead  [staring straight ahead - глядел прямо перед собой] of her with unseeing eyes  [unseeing eyes - невидящие глаза] at the great pine woods, [great pine woods - большой сосновый лес]  the stumps of the clearing, the long, gleaming rails. [gleaming rails - блестящие рельсы]  There was only one thought  [one thought - одна мысль] in her dazed mind—a thought that seemed to burn it as a shaving of fire might burn  [fire might burn - огонь мог гореть] her body.

Dr. Trent had told her over a year ago  [year ago - год назад] that she had a serious form  [serious form - серьезная форма] of heart-disease—that any excitement might  [excitement might - волнение мог] be fatal.

If that were so, why was she not dead now? This very minute? She had just experienced as much and as terrible excitement  [terrible excitement - ужасное волнение] as most people experience  [people experience - люди испытывают] in a lifetime, crowded into that endless thirty seconds. [endless thirty seconds - бесконечный тридцать секунд]  Yet she had not died of it. She was not an iota the worse for it. A little wobbly  [little wobbly - немного шатается] at the knees, as any one would  [one would - будет] have been; a quicker heart- [quicker heart - учащенное сердце] beat, as any one would have; nothing more.

Why!

_Was it possible Dr. [possible dr - возможный доктор]  Trent had made a mistake?_

Valancy shivered  [valancy shivered - валэнси вздрогнула] as if a cold wind  [cold wind -  холодный ветер] had suddenly chilled  [suddenly chilled - внезапно похолодело] her to the soul. She looked at Barney, hunched up beside her. His silence was very eloquent. Had the same thought occurred  [thought occurred - пришла мысль] to him? Did he suddenly find  [suddenly find - внезапно найти] himself confronted by the appalling suspicion  [appalling suspicion - ужасающее подозрение] that he was married, not for a few months or a year, but for good and all to a woman he did not love and who had foisted herself upon him by some trick or lie? Valancy turned sick  [valancy turned sick - валэнси заболела] before the horror of it. It could not be. It would be too cruel—too devilish. Dr. Trent _couldn’t_ have made a mistake. Impossible. He was one of the best heart specialists  [best heart specialists - лучшие специалисты по сердечным заболеваниям] in Ontario. She was foolish—unnerved by the recent horror. [recent horror - недавний ужас]  She remembered some of the hideous spasms  [hideous spasms - ужасные спазмы] of pain she had had. There must be something serious  [something serious - что-то серьезное] the matter with her heart to account for them.

But she had not had any for nearly three months. [nearly three months - почти три месяца] 

Why?

Presently Barney bestirred  [presently barney bestirred - сейчас барни зашевелился] himself. He stood up, without looking  [without looking - не глядя] at Valancy, and said casually: [said casually - сказал небрежно] 

“I suppose we’d better be hiking back. [hiking back - возвращался]  Sun’s getting low. [getting low - опустился]  Are you good for the rest of the road?”

“I think so,” said Valancy miserably.

Barney went across  [barney went across - барни перешел] the clearing and picked up the parcel he had dropped—the parcel containing  [parcel containing - посылку, содержащую] her new shoes. [new shoes - новую обувь]  He brought it to her and let her take out the shoes and put them on without any assistance, while he stood with his back to her and looked out over the pines.

They walked in silence down the shadowy trail  [shadowy trail - теневая тропа] to the lake. In silence Barney steered  [silence barney steered - тишина, барни рулил] his boat into the sunset miracle  [sunset miracle - чудо заката] that was Mistawis. In silence they went around feathery headlands and across coral bays  [across coral bays - через коралловые бухты] and silver rivers  [silver rivers -  серебряные реки] where canoes were slipping up and down in the afterglow. In silence they went past cottages echoing with music and laughter. In silence drew  [silence drew - тишина нарисовалась] up at the landing-place below the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок] 

Valancy went  [valancy went - валенси ушла] up the rock steps  [rock steps - ступени скалы] and into the house. She dropped miserably  [dropped miserably - с треском упала] on the first chair  [first chair - первый стул] she came to and sat there staring through the oriel, oblivious of Good Luck’s frantic purrs  [frantic purrs - неистовое мурлыканье] of joy and Banjo’s savage glares  [savage glares - дикие взгляды] of protest at her occupancy of his chair.

Barney came  [barney came - барни подошел] in a few minutes later. [minutes later - минуты позже]  He did not come near  [come near - подойди ближе] her, but he stood behind  [stood behind - отстала] her and asked gently  [asked gently - спросил мягко] if she felt any the worse for her experience. Valancy would  [valancy would - валэнси бы] have given her year of happiness to have been able honestly  [able honestly - умела честно] to answer “Yes.”

“No,” she said flatly. [said flatly - сказала категорически ] 

Barney went  [barney went - барни ушел] into Bluebeard’s Chamber and shut the door. She heard him pacing up and down—up and down. He had never paced like  [never paced like - никогда не ходил так, как] that before.

And an hour ago—only an hour ago—she had been so happy!



 CHAPTER XXXVI [chapter xxxvi - глава xxxvi] 

 Finally Valancy went  [finally valancy went - наконец-то вэлэнси ушел] to bed. Before she went she re-read Dr. [read dr - прочитал доктора]  Trent’s letter. It comforted her a little. So positive. So assured. The writing so black and steady. Not the writing of a man who didn’t know what he was writing about. But she could not sleep. She pretended to be asleep when Barney came  [barney came - барни пришел] in. Barney pretended  [barney pretended - барни притворился] to go to sleep. But Valancy knew perfectly well he wasn’t sleeping any more than she was. She knew he was lying there, staring through the darkness. Thinking of what? Trying to face—what?

Valancy, who had spent so many happy wakeful hours of night lying  [night lying - ночь лежал] by that window, now paid the price of them all in this one night  [one night - одна ночь] of misery. A horrible, portentous fact  [portentous fact - знаменательный факт] was slowly looming  [slowly looming - медленно вырисовывался] out before her from the nebula of surmise and fear. She could not shut her eyes to it—push it away—ignore it.

There could be nothing seriously wrong  [nothing seriously wrong - ничего серьезного] with her heart, no matter what Dr. Trent had said. If there had been, those thirty seconds would  [thirty seconds would - тридцать секунд было бы] have killed her. It was no use to recall Dr. [recall dr - вспомните доктора]  Trent’s letter and reputation. The greatest specialists made mistakes sometimes. Dr. Trent had made one. [made one - сделал один] 

Towards morning Valancy fell into a fitful dose  [fitful dose - судорожная доза] with ridiculous dreams. [ridiculous dreams - нелепые сны]  One of them was of Barney taunting  [barney taunting - насмешка над барни] her with having tricked him. In her dream she lost her temper and struck him violently on the head with her rolling-pin. He proved to be made of glass and shivered into splinters all over the floor. She woke with a cry of horror—a gasp of relief—a short laugh  [short laugh - короткий смех] over the absurdity of her dream—a miserable sickening recollection  [miserable sickening recollection -  жалкое тошнотворное воспоминание] of what had happened.

Barney was gone. Valancy knew, [valancy knew - валэнси знала]  as people sometimes know things—inescapably, without being told—that he was not in the house or in Bluebeard’s Chamber either. [chamber either - комната тоже]  There was a curious silence  [curious silence - любопытная тишина] in the living-room. A silence with something uncanny  [something uncanny - что-то сверхъестественное] about it. The old clock  [old clock - старые часы] had stopped. Barney must  [barney must - барни должен] have forgotten to wind it up, something he had never done  [never done - никогда не заканчивалась] before. The room without  [room without - комната без] it was dead, though the sunshine streamed  [sunshine streamed - солнце струилось] in through the oriel and dimples of light from the dancing waves beyond quivered over the walls.

The canoe was gone but Lady Jane  [lady jane - леди джейн] was under the mainland trees. [mainland trees - материковые деревья]  So Barney had betaken himself to the wilds. He would not return till night—perhaps not even then. He must be angry with her. That furious silence  [furious silence - яростное молчание] of his must mean anger—cold, deep, justifiable resentment. [justifiable resentment - оправданное негодование]  Well, Valancy knew  [valancy knew - валэнси знала] what she must do first. She was not suffering very keenly now. Yet the curious numbness  [curious numbness - любопытное оцепенение] that pervaded her being was in a way worse  [way worse - гораздо хуже] than pain. It was as if something in her had died. She forced herself to cook and eat a little breakfast. [little breakfast - маленький завтрак]  Mechanically she put the Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] in perfect order. [perfect order - идеальный порядок]  Then she put on her hat and coat, locked the door and hid the key in the hollow of the old pine  [old pine - старая сосна] and crossed to the mainland in the motor boat. [motor boat - моторная лодка]  She was going into Deerwood to see Dr. [see dr - понимаете доктор]  Trent. She must _know_.



 CHAPTER XXXVII [chapter xxxvii - глава xxxvii] 

 Dr. Trent looked  [trent looked - трент посмотрел] at her blankly and fumbled among  [fumbled among - возился среди] his recollections.

“Er—Miss—Miss—”

“Mrs. Snaith,” said Valancy quietly. “I was Miss Valancy Stirling  [miss valancy stirling - мисс валэнси стирлинг] when I came to you last May—over a year ago. [year ago - год назад]  I wanted to consult you about my heart.”

Dr. Trent’s face cleared. [face cleared - лицо очистилось ] 

“Oh, of course. I remember now. I’m really not to blame for not knowing you. You’ve changed—splendidly. And married. Well, well, it has agreed with you. You don’t look much like  [look much like - похоже на] an invalid now, hey? I remember that day. I was badly upset. [badly upset - сильно расстроен]  Hearing about poor Ned bowled  [poor ned bowled - бедняжку Неда в боулинге] me over. But Ned’s as good as new and you, too, evidently. I told you so, you know—told you there was nothing to worry over.”

Valancy looked  [valancy looked - валэнси выглядел] at him.

“You told me, in your letter,” she said slowly, [said slowly - сказал медленно]  with a curious feeling  [curious feeling - любопытное чувство] that some one else  [one else - еще один] was talking through her lips, “that I had angina pectoris—in the last stages—complicated with an aneurism. That I might die  [might die - может умереть] any minute—that I couldn’t live longer  [live longer - жить дольше] than a year.”

Dr. Trent stared  [trent stared - трент уставился] at her.

“Impossible!” he said blankly. [said blankly - сказал безучастно]  “I couldn’t have told you that!”

Valancy took  [valancy took - валэнси взял] his letter from her bag and handed it to him.

“Miss Valancy Stirling,” he read. “Yes—yes. Of course I wrote you—on the train—that night. But I _told_ you there was nothing serious——”

“Read your letter,” insisted Valancy.

Dr. Trent took  [trent took - трент взял] it out—unfolded it—glanced over it. A dismayed look came  [dismayed look came - пришел встревоженный взгляд] into his face. He jumped to his feet and strode agitatedly  [strode agitatedly - шагал взволнованно] about the room.

Valancy stood  [valancy stood - вэлэнси стояла] up, turned round, [turned round - обернулась]  looked foolishly  [looked foolishly - посмотрела глупо] about her and sat down again.

“I believed it,” she said faintly. [said faintly - сказала слабо]  “I didn’t go to any other doctor. I—I—it would take  [would take - возьмет] too long to explain. But I believed I was going to die soon.”

Dr. Trent halted  [trent halted - трент остановился] before her.

“I can never forgive  [never forgive - никогда не прощала] myself. What a year you must have had! But you don’t look—I can’t understand!”

“Never mind,” said Valancy dully. “And so there’s nothing the matter with my heart?”

“Well, nothing serious. [nothing serious - ничего серьезного]  You had what is called pseudo- [called pseudo - назвала псевдо] angina. It’s never fatal—passes away completely with proper treatment. [proper treatment - надлежащее лечение]  Or sometimes with a shock of joy. Have you been troubled much  [troubled much - много беспокоила] with it?”

“Not at all since March,” answered Valancy. She remembered the marvellous feeling  [marvellous feeling - чудесное чувство] of re-creation she had had when she saw Barney coming home safe after the storm. Had that “shock of joy” cured her?

“Then likely you’re all right. I told you what to do in the letter you should have got. _And_ of course I supposed you’d go to another doctor. [another doctor - другой доктор]  Child, why didn’t you?”

“I didn’t want anybody  [want anybody - хочу, чтобы кто-нибудь] to know.”

“Idiot,” said Dr. Trent bluntly. [trent bluntly - трент прямо]  “I can’t understand such folly. And poor old Miss Sterling. She must have got your letter—telling her there was nothing serious  [nothing serious - ничего серьезного] the matter. Well, well, it couldn’t have made any difference. Her case was hopeless. Nothing that she could have done or left undone could  [left undone could - недоделанный мог] have made any difference. I was surprised she lived as long as she did—two months. She was here that day—not long before you. I hated to tell her the truth. You think I’m a blunt old curmudgeon—and my letters _are_ blunt enough. I can’t soften things. [soften things - смягчить вещи]  But I’m a snivelling coward  [snivelling coward - хнычущий трус] when it comes to telling a woman face  [woman face -  женское лицо] to face that she’s got to die soon. [die soon - скорая смерть]  I told her I’d look up some features of the case I wasn’t quite sure  [quite sure - совершенно уверен] of and let her know next day. [know next day - узнать на следующий день]  But you got her letter—look here, ‘Dear Miss S-t-_e_-r-l-i-n-g.’”

“Yes. I noticed that. But I thought it a mistake. I didn’t know there were any Sterlings in Port Lawrence.”

“She was the only one. A lonely old soul. [lonely old soul - одинокая старая душа]  Lived by herself with only a little home girl. [little home girl - маленькая домашняя девочка]  She died two months  [died two months - умерла два месяца] after she was here—died in her sleep. My mistake couldn’t have made any difference to her. But you! I can’t forgive myself for inflicting a year’s misery on you. It’s time I retired, all right, when I do things like  [things like - что-то вроде] that—even if my son was supposed to be fatally injured. [fatally injured - смертельно раненый]  Can you ever forgive  [ever forgive - навсегда простить] me?”

A year of misery! Valancy smiled  [valancy smiled - валэнси улыбнулась] a tortured smile  [tortured smile - мучительная улыбка] as she thought of all the happiness Dr. [happiness dr - счастье доктор ]  Trent’s mistake had bought her. But she was paying for it now—oh, she was paying. If to feel was to live she was living with a vengeance.

She let Dr. [let dr - пусть доктор]  Trent examine  [trent examine - трент проверил] her and answered all his questions. When he told her she was fit as a fiddle and would probably live  [would probably live - вероятно, выжил бы] to be a hundred, she got up and went away silently. [went away silently - ушел молча]  She knew that there were a great many horrible things outside waiting to be thought over. Dr. Trent thought  [trent thought - трент подумал] she was odd. Anybody would  [anybody would - кто-нибудь бы] have thought, from her hopeless eyes  [hopeless eyes - безнадежные глаза] and woebegone face, [woebegone face - унылое лицо]  that he had given her a sentence of death instead  [death instead - вместо смерти] of life. Snaith? Snaith? Who the devil had she married? He had never heard  [never heard - никогда не слышал] of Snaiths in Deerwood. And she had been such a sallow, faded, little old maid. [little old maid - маленькая старая дева]  Gad, but marriage _had_ made a difference in her, anyhow, whoever Snaith  [whoever snaith - кто бы ни змея] was. Snaith? Dr. Trent remembered. [trent remembered - трент помнил]  That rapscallion “u [rapscallion “ - мошенник «] p back!” Had Valancy Stirling married _him_? And her clan had let her! Well, probably that solved the mystery. She had married in haste and repented at leisure, and that was why she wasn’t overjoyed at learning she was a good insurance prospect, [good insurance prospect - хорошая страховая перспектива]  after all. Married! To God knew  [god knew - бог знал] whom! Or what! Jail-bird? Defaulter? Fugitive from justice? It must be pretty bad  [pretty bad - довольно плохо] if she had looked to death as a release, poor girl. [poor girl - бедная девочка ]  But why were women such fools? Dr. Trent dismissed Valancy  [trent dismissed valancy - трент уволил вэлэнси] from his mind, though to the day of his death he was ashamed of putting those letters into the wrong envelopes. [wrong envelopes - неправильные конверты] 



 CHAPTER XXXVIII [chapter xxxviii - глава xxxviii] 

 Valancy walked quickly  [valancy walked quickly - валэнси шла быстро] through the back streets  [back streets - закоулки] and through Lover’s Lane. She did not want to meet any one she knew. She didn’t want to meet even people  [meet even people - встречала ровных людей] she didn’t know. She hated to be seen. Her mind was so confused, so torn, so messy. She felt that her appearance must  [appearance must - внешность должна] be the same. She drew a sobbing breath  [sobbing breath - рыдающее дыхание] of relief as she left the village behind  [village behind - деревня позади] and found herself on the “up back” road. There was little fear  [little fear - маленький страх ] of meeting any one she knew here. The cars that fled by her with raucous shrieks  [raucous shrieks - хриплые крики] were filled with strangers. One of them was packed with young people  [young people - молодежь] who whirled past  [whirled past - проносилась мимо] her singing uproariously: [singing uproariously - бурное пение] 

“My wife has the fever, O then, My wife has the fever, O then, My wife has the fever, Oh, I hope it won’t leave her, For I want to be single again.”

 Valancy flinched  [valancy flinched - валэнси вздрогнула] as if one of them had leaned from the car and cut her across the face with a whip.

She had made a covenant with death and death had cheated her. Now life stood mocking  [life stood mocking - жизнь стояла насмешливая] her. She had trapped Barney. [trapped barney - барни в ловушке]  Trapped him into marrying her. And divorce was so hard to get in Ontario. So expensive. And Barney was poor.

With life, fear had come back  [come back - возвращаться] into her heart. Sickening fear. [sickening fear - тошный страх]  Fear of what Barney would think. [barney would think - барни подумал бы]  Would say. [would say - сказал бы]  Fear of the future that must be lived without  [lived without - жил без] him. Fear of her insulted, repudiated clan. [repudiated clan - отвергнутый клан] 

She had had one draught  [one draught - один глоток] from a divine cup  [divine cup - божественная чаша] and now it was dashed from her lips. With no kind, friendly death  [friendly death - дружная смерть ] to rescue her. She must go  [must go - должен уйти] on living and longing for it. Everything was spoiled, smirched, defaced. Even that year in the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  Even her unashamed love  [unashamed love - бесстыдная любовь] for Barney. It had been beautiful because death waited. [death waited - смерть ждала]  Now it was only sordid because death was gone. How could any one bear  [one bear - один медведь] an unbearable thing? [unbearable thing - невыносимая вещь] 

She must go back  [must go back - должен вернуться] and tell him. Make him believe she had not meant to trick him—she _must_ make him believe that. She must say good- [must say good - должен сказать хорошо] bye to her Blue Castle  [blue castle - голубой замок] and return to the brick house  [brick house - кирпичный дом] on Elm Street. [elm street - улица вязов]  Back to everything she had thought left behind forever. The old bondage—the old fears. [old fears - старые страхи]  But that did not matter. All that mattered now was that Barney must somehow  [barney must somehow - барни должен как-то] be made to believe she had not consciously tricked  [consciously tricked - сознательно обманули] him.

When Valancy reached  [valancy reached - валанс достигнут] the pines by the lake she was brought out of her daze of pain by a startling sight. [startling sight - поразительное зрелище]  There, parked by the side of old, battered ragged Lady Jane, was another car. [another car - еще одна машина]  A wonderful car. [wonderful car - замечательная машина]  A purple car. [purple car - фиолетовый автомобиль]  Not a dark, royal purple  [royal purple - королевский пурпур] but a blatant, screaming purple. [screaming purple - кричаще-фиолетовый]  It shone like  [shone like - сиял как] a mirror and its interior plainly indicated  [interior plainly indicated - интерьер ясно указан] the car caste  [car caste - каста автомобилей] of Vere de Vere. [vere de vere - вере-де-вере]  On the driver’s seat sat  [seat sat - сиденье сидело] a haughty chauffeur  [haughty chauffeur - надменный шофер] in livery. And in the tonneau sat  [tonneau sat - тонно сидел] a man who opened the door and bounced out nimbly as Valancy came  [valancy came - валанс пришел] down the path to the landing-place. He stood under the pines waiting  [pines waiting - сосны ждут] for her and Valancy took  [valancy took - валентность взяла ] in every detail  [every detail - каждая деталь] of him.

A stout, short, pudgy man, [pudgy man - пухлый мужчина]  with a broad, rubicund, good-humoured face—a clean-shaven face, [shaven face - бритое лицо]  though an unparalysed little imp  [unparalysed little imp - непарализованный маленький чертёнок] at the back of Valancy’s paralysed mind suggested  [paralysed mind suggested - предполагается, что парализованный разум] the thought, “Such a face should have a fringe of white whisker around  [white whisker around - белые бакенбарды вокруг] it.” Old- [.” old - ». старый] fashioned, steel-rimmed spectacles  [rimmed spectacles - очки в оправе] on prominent blue eyes. [prominent blue eyes - выдающиеся голубые глаза ]  A pursey mouth; [pursey mouth - рот-кошелек]  a little round, [little round - маленькие круглые]  knobby nose. [knobby nose - шишковатый нос]  Where—where—where, groped Valancy, [groped valancy - ощупанный балдахин]  had she seen that face before? It seemed as familiar to her as her own.

“Can you tell me, Miss, if that house yonder belongs  [house yonder belongs - дом вон там принадлежит] to a Mr. Redfern? And if so, how can I get to it?”

Redfern! A vision of bottles seemed  [bottles seemed - бутылки казались] to dance before Valancy’s eyes—long bottles of bitters—round bottles of hair tonic—square bottles of liniment—short, corpulent little bottles  [corpulent little bottles - толстые маленькие бутылочки] of purple pills—and all of them bearing that very prosperous, beaming moon- [beaming moon - сияющая луна] face and steel-rimmed spectacles  [rimmed spectacles - очки в оправе] on the label.

Dr. Redfern!

“No,” said Valancy faintly. “No—that house belongs  [house belongs - дом принадлежит] to Mr. Snaith.”

Dr. Redfern nodded. [redfern nodded - редферн кивнул] 

“Yes, I understand Bernie’s been calling himself Snaith. Well, it’s his middle name—was his poor mother’s. Bernard Snaith Redfern—that’s him. And now, Miss, you can tell me how to get over to that island? Nobody seems  [nobody seems - никто не кажется] to be home there. I’ve done some waving and yelling. Henry, there, wouldn’t yell. He’s a one-job man. [job man - рабочий]  But old Doc Redfern  [old doc redfern - старый док редферн] can yell with the best of them yet, and ain’t above doing it. Raised nothing  [raised nothing - ничего не поднял] but a couple of crows. Guess Bernie’s out for the day.”

“He was away when I left this morning,” said Valancy. “I suppose he hasn’t come home yet.”

She spoke flatly  [spoke flatly - говорит ровно] and tonelessly. This last shock  [last shock - последний шок] had temporarily bereft  [temporarily bereft - временно лишен ] her of whatever little power  [whatever little power - какая бы маленькая сила] of reasoning had been left her by Dr. Trent’s revelation. In the back of her mind the aforesaid little imp  [aforesaid little imp - вышеупомянутый маленький бесенок] was jeeringly repeating  [jeeringly repeating - насмешливо повторяет] a silly old proverb, [silly old proverb - глупая старая пословица]  “It never rains  [never rains - никогда не идет дождь] but it pours.” But she was not trying to think. What was the use?

Dr. Redfern was gazing at her in perplexity.

“When you left this morning? Do you live—over there?”

He waved his diamond at the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок] 

“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. “I’m his wife.”

Dr. Redfern took  [redfern took - редферн взял] out a yellow silk handkerchief, [yellow silk handkerchief - желтый шелковый платок]  removed his hat and mopped his brow. He was very bald, and Valancy’s imp whispered, [imp whispered - бесенок прошептал]  “Why be bald? Why lose your manly beauty? [manly beauty - мужскую красоту]  Try Redfern’s Hair Vigor. [hair vigor - энергию волос]  It keeps you young.”

“Excuse me,” said Dr. [,” said dr - , – сказал доктор]  Redfern. “This is a bit of a shock.”

“Shocks seem to be in the air this morning.” The imp said  [imp said - имп сказал] this out loud before Valancy could prevent  [valancy could prevent - валэнси мог предотвратить] it.

“I didn’t know Bernie  [know bernie - знай берни] was—married. I didn’t think he _would_ have got married without telling his old dad.”

Were Dr. Redfern’s eyes misty? [eyes misty -  глаза затуманены]  Amid her own dull ache  [dull ache - тупая боль] of misery and fear and dread, Valancy felt  [valancy felt - валенси войлок] a pang of pity for him.

“Don’t blame him,” she said hurriedly. [said hurriedly - сказал торопливо]  “It—it wasn’t his fault. It—was all my doing.”

“You didn’t ask him to marry you, I suppose,” twinkled Dr. Redfern. “He might have let me know. I’d have got acquainted  [got acquainted - познакомились] with my daughter-in-law before this if he had. But I’m glad to meet you now, my dear—very glad. You look like  [look like - похожи] a sensible young woman. [sensible young woman - разумная молодая женщина]  I used to sorter fear Barney’d pick out some pretty bit  [pretty bit - немножко] of fluff just because she was good-looking. They were all after him, of course. Wanted his money? Eh? Didn’t like the pills and the bitters but liked the dollars. Eh? Wanted to dip their pretty little fingers  [pretty little fingers - симпатичные пальчики] in old Doc’s millions. Eh?”

“Millions!” said Valancy faintly. She wished she could sit  [could sit - может сидеть] down somewhere—she wished she could have a chance to think—she wished she and the Blue Castle could sink to the bottom of Mistawis and vanish from human sight forevermore. [human sight forevermore - человеческий взгляд навсегда] 

“Millions,” said Dr. Redfern complacently. [redfern complacently - редферн самодовольно]  “And Bernie chucks  [bernie chucks - берни чакс] them for—that.” Again he shook the diamond contemptuously  [diamond contemptuously - алмаз презрительно ] at the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  “Wouldn’t you think he’d have more sense? And all on account of a white bit  [white bit - белый бит] of a girl. He must have got over _that_ feeling, anyhow, since he’s married. You must persuade  [must persuade - должен убедить] him to come back  [come back - возвращайся] to civilisation. All nonsense wasting  [nonsense wasting - ерунда тратит] his life like  [life like - жизнь как] this. Ain’t you going to take me over to your house, my dear? I suppose you’ve some way of getting there.”

“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly. She led the way down to the little cove  [little cove - маленькая бухта] where the disappearing propeller boat  [disappearing propeller boat - исчезающая пропеллерная лодка] was snuggled.

“Does your—your man want  [man want - мужчина нужен] to come, too?”

“Who? Henry. Not he. Look at him sitting there disapproving. Disapproves of the whole expedition. [whole expedition - целая экспедиция]  The trail up from the road nearly gave  [road nearly gave - дорога чуть не подвела] him a conniption. Well, it _was_ a devilish road  [devilish road - дьявольская дорога] to put a car on. Whose old bus  [whose old bus - чей старый автобус] is that up there?”

“Barney’s.”

“Good Lord! Does Bernie Redfern ride  [bernie redfern ride - поездка берни редферна] in a thing like  [thing like - что-то вроде] that? It looks like  [looks like - похоже] the great-great-grand-mother of all the Fords.”

“It isn’t a Ford. It’s a Grey Slosson,” said Valancy spiritedly. For some occult reason, [occult reason - оккультный разум]  Dr. Redfern’s good-humoured ridicule  [humoured ridicule - юмористическая насмешка] of dear old Lady Jane stung her to life. A life that was all pain but still _life_. Better than the horrible half- [horrible half - ужасная половина] dead-and-half-aliveness of the past few minutes—or years. She waved Dr. [waved dr - махнул др]  Redfern curtly  [redfern curtly - красный папоротник коротко] into the boat and took him over to the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  The key was still in the old pine—the house still silent  [house still silent - дом все еще тихий] and deserted. Valancy took  [valancy took - валенси взял] the doctor through the living-room to the western verandah. [western verandah - западная веранда]  She must at least be out where there was air. It was still sunny, [still sunny - все еще солнечно ]  but in the southwest a great thundercloud, [great thundercloud - великая грозовая туча]  with white crests  [white crests - белые гребни] and gorges of purple shadow, [purple shadow - фиолетовая тень]  was slowly rising  [slowly rising - медленно поднимается] over Mistawis. The doctor dropped  [doctor dropped - доктор упал] with a gasp on a rustic chair  [rustic chair - деревенское кресло] and mopped his brow again.

“Warm, eh? Lord, what a view! Wonder if it would soften Henry  [would soften henry - смягчил бы генри] if he could see  [could see - мог видеть] it.”

“Have you had dinner?” asked Valancy.

“Yes, my dear—had it before we left Port Lawrence. [left port lawrence - уехала из порта лоуренса]  Didn’t know what sort of wild hermit’s hollow we were coming to, you see. Hadn’t any idea I was going to find a nice little daughter- [nice little daughter -  милая маленькая дочка] in-law here all ready to toss me up a meal. Cats, eh? Puss, puss! See that. Cats love  [cats love - любит кошек] me. Bernie was always fond  [always fond - всегда любит] of cats! It’s about the only thing he took from me. He’s his poor mother’s boy.”

Valancy had been thinking idly  [thinking idly - думает праздно] that Barney must resemble  [barney must resemble - барни должен походить] his mother. She had remained standing  [remained standing - осталась стоять] by the steps, but Dr. Redfern waved  [redfern waved - редферн помахал] her to the swing seat. [swing seat - качели] 

“Sit down, dear. Never stand  [never stand - никогда не стоять] when you can sit. I want to get a good look  [good look - хороший вид] at Barney’s wife. Well, well, I like your face. No beauty—you don’t mind my saying that—you’ve sense enough  [sense enough - достаточно здравого смысла] to know it, I reckon. Sit down.”

Valancy sat  [valancy sat - валэнси сидел] down. To be obliged to sit still  [sit still - сидеть на месте] when mental agony urges us to stride up and down is the refinement of torture. Every nerve  [every nerve - каждый нерв ] in her being was crying out to be alone—to be hidden. But she had to sit and listen to Dr. Redfern, who didn’t mind talking  [mind talking - мыслю говорить] at all.

“When do you think Bernie  [think bernie - думаю, берни] will be back?”

“I don’t know—not before night probably.”

“Where did he go?”

“I don’t know that either. Likely to the woods—up back.”

“So he doesn’t tell you his comings and goings, either? Bernie was always a secretive young devil. [secretive young devil - скрытный юный дьявол]  Never understood  [never understood - никогда не понимала] him. Just like his poor mother. [poor mother - бедная мать]  But I thought a lot of him. It hurt me when he disappeared as he did. Eleven years ago. [eleven years ago - одиннадцать лет назад]  I haven’t seen my boy for eleven years.”

“Eleven years.” Valancy was surprised. “It’s only six since  [six since - шесть с тех пор] he came here.”

“Oh, he was in the Klondike before that—and all over the world. He used to drop me a line now and then—never give any clue to where he was but just a line to say he was all right. I s’pose he’s told you all about it.”

“No. I know nothing  [know nothing - ничего не знаю] of his past life,” said Valancy with sudden eagerness. [sudden eagerness - внезапное рвение]  She wanted to know—she must know  [must know - должна знать] now. It hadn’t mattered before. Now she must know all. And she could never hear  [could never hear - никогда не могла слышать] it from Barney. She might never even see him again. If she did, it would not be to talk of his past.

“What happened? Why did he leave his home? Tell me. Tell me.”

“Well, it ain’t much of a story. Just a young fool gone mad because of a quarrel with his girl. Only Bernie was a stubborn fool. [stubborn fool - упрямый дурак]  Always stubborn. [always stubborn - всегда упрямый]  You never could make  [never could make - никогда не мог сделать] that boy do anything he didn’t want to do. From the day he was born. Yet he was always a quiet, gentle little chap, [gentle little chap - нежный маленький парень]  too. Good as gold. His poor mother died  [poor mother died - бедная мать умерла] when he was only two years old. [two years old - два года]  I’d just begun to make money  [make money -  делать деньги] with my Hair Vigor. [hair vigor - энергия волос]  I’d dreamed the formula for it, you see. Some dream that. The cash rolled  [cash rolled - наличные деньги] in. Bernie had everything he wanted. I sent him to the best schools—private schools. I meant to make a gentleman of him. Never had any chance myself. Meant he should have every chance. [every chance - каждый шанс]  He went through McGill. Got honours  [got honours - получил почести] and all that. I wanted him to go in for law. He hankered after journalism and stuff like  [stuff like - вещи как] that. Wanted me to buy a paper for him—or back him in publishing what he called a ‘real, worthwhile, honest-to-goodness Canadian Magazine.’ I s’pose I’d have done it—I always did what he wanted me to do. Wasn’t he all I had to live for? I wanted him to be happy. And he never was happy. Can you believe it? Not that he said so. But I’d always a feeling that he wasn’t happy. Everything he wanted—all the money he could spend—his own bank account—travel—seeing the world—but he wasn’t happy. Not till he fell in love with Ethel Traverse. [ethel traverse - этель траверс]  Then he was happy for a little while.”

The cloud had reached the sun and a great, chill, purple shadow came swiftly over Mistawis. It touched the Blue Castle—rolled over it. Valancy shivered. [valancy shivered - валентность дрожала] 

“Yes,” she said, with painful eagerness, [painful eagerness - мучительное рвение]  though every word  [though every word - хотя каждое слово] was cutting her to the heart. “What—was—she—like?”

“Prettiest girl in Montreal,” said Dr. Redfern. “Oh, she was a looker, all right. Eh? Gold hair—shiny as silk—great, big, soft, black eyes—skin like milk and roses. Don’t wonder Bernie fell  [wonder bernie fell - чудо, как Берни упал] for her. And brains as well. _She_ wasn’t a bit of fluff. B. A. from McGill. A thoroughbred, too. One of the best families. [best families - лучшие семьи]  But a bit lean  [bit lean - немного поджарый ] in the purse. Eh! Bernie was mad about her. Happiest young fool  [happiest young fool - самый счастливый молодой дурак] you ever saw. [ever saw - когда-либо видел]  Then—the bust-up.”

“Blest if I know, my dear. Some fool quarrel, [fool quarrel - дурацкая ссора]  I suppose. Bernie just lit out—disappeared. He wrote me from the Yukon. Said his engagement was broken and he wasn’t coming back. [coming back - возвращаюсь]  And not to try to hunt him up because he was never coming back. [never coming back - никогда не вернусь]  I didn’t. What was the use? I knew Bernie. [knew bernie - знал берни]  I went on piling, up money because there wasn’t anything else  [anything else - что-то еще] to do. But I was mighty lonely. [mighty lonely - сильно одиноко]  All I lived for was them little notes  [little notes - небольшие заметки] now and then from Bernie—Klondike—England—South Africa—China—everywhere. I thought maybe  [thought maybe - думал, может быть] he’d come back  [come back - возвращаюсь] some day to his lonesome old dad. [lonesome old dad - одинокий старый папа]  Then six years ago even the letters stopped. [letters stopped - письма прекратились]  I didn’t hear a word of or from him till last Christmas.”

“Did he write?”

“No. But he drew a check for fifteen thousand dollars  [fifteen thousand dollars - пятнадцать тысяч долларов] on his bank account. [bank account - банковский счет]  The bank manager  [bank manager - управляющий банком] is a friend of mine—one of my biggest shareholders. [biggest shareholders - самый большой акционеры]  He’d always promised  [always promised - всегда обещал] me he’d let me know if Bernie drew  [bernie drew - берни дрю] any checks. Bernie had fifty thousand  [fifty thousand - пятьдесят тысяч] there. And he’d never touched  [never touched - никогда не трогал] a cent of it till last Christmas. [till last christmas - до прошлого рождества]  The check was made out to Aynsley’s, Toronto——”

“Aynsley’s?” Valancy heard herself saying Aynsley’s! She had a box on her dressing-table with the Aynsley trademark. [aynsley trademark - торговая марка эйнсли] 

“Yes. The big jewellery house  [big jewellery house - большой ювелирный дом] there. After I’d thought it over a while, I got brisk. [got brisk - оживился]  I wanted to locate Bernie. [locate bernie - найди берни]  Had a special reason  [special reason - особая причина] for it. It was time he gave up his fool hoboing  [fool hoboing - дурак бродяга] and come to his senses. Drawing that fifteen told  [fifteen told - пятнадцать сказал] me there was something in the wind. The manager communicated  [manager communicated -  менеджер связался] with the Aynsleys—his wife was an Aynsley—and found out that Bernard Redfern  [bernard redfern - бернард редферн] had bought a pearl necklace  [pearl necklace - жемчужное ожерелье] there. His address was given as Box 444, [box 444 - ящик 444]  Port Lawrence, [port lawrence - порт лоуренс]  Muskoka, Ont. First I thought I’d write. Then I thought I’d wait till  [wait till - подожди] the open season  [open season - открытый сезон] for cars and come down myself. Ain’t no hand at writing. I’ve motored from Montreal. Got to Port Lawrence yesterday. [port lawrence yesterday - порт лоуренс вчера]  Enquired at the post-office. Told me they knew nothing  [knew nothing - ничего не знал] of any Bernard Snaith Redfern, [bernard snaith redfern - бернард снайт редферн]  but there was a Barney Snaith  [barney snaith - барни снайт] had a P. O. box there. Lived on an island out here, they said. So here I am. And where’s Barney?”

Valancy was fingering her necklace. She was wearing fifteen thousand dollars around her neck. And she had worried lest Barney  [worried lest barney - беспокоился, как бы Барни] had paid fifteen dollars  [paid fifteen dollars - платил пятнадцать долларов] for it and couldn’t afford it. Suddenly she laughed in Dr. Redfern’s face.

“Excuse me. It’s so—amusing,” said poor Valancy.

“Isn’t it?” said Dr. Redfern, seeing a joke—but not exactly hers. “Now, you seem like  [seem like - выглядеть как] a sensible young woman, [sensible young woman - разумная молодая женщина]  and I dare say  [dare say - смею сказать] you’ve lots of influence over Bernie. Can’t you get him to come back  [come back - вернись ] to civilisation and live like  [live like - жить как] other people? I’ve a house up there. Big as a castle. Furnished like  [furnished like - обставлен как] a palace. I want company  [want company - хочу компанию] in it—Bernie’s wife—Bernie’s children.”

“Did Ethel Traverse ever marry?” queried Valancy irrelevantly.

“Bless you, yes. Two years  [two years - два года] after Bernie levanted. [bernie levanted - берни левантед]  But she’s a widow now. Pretty as ever. To be frank, that was my special reason  [special reason - особая причина] for wanting to find Bernie. [find bernie - найти берни]  I thought they’d make it up, maybe. But, of course, that’s all off now. Doesn’t matter. Bernie’s choice of a wife is good enough  [good enough - достаточно веская] for me. It’s my boy I want. Think he’ll soon be back?”

“I don’t know. But I don’t think he’ll come before night. Quite late, [quite late - довольно поздно]  perhaps. And perhaps not till tomorrow. [till tomorrow - до завтра]  But I can put you up comfortably. He’ll certainly be back tomorrow.”

Dr. Redfern shook  [redfern shook - редферн трясся] his head.

“Too damp. I’ll take no chances with rheumatism.”

“Why suffer that ceaseless anguish? [ceaseless anguish - бесконечная тоска]  Why not try Redfern’s Liniment?” quoted the imp in the back of Valancy’s mind.

“I must get back  [must get back - должен вернуться] to Port Lawrence  [port lawrence - порт лоуренс] before rain starts. [rain starts - начинается дождь]  Henry goes quite mad when he gets mud  [gets mud - испачкается] on the car. But I’ll come back tomorrow. [come back tomorrow - вернись завтра]  Meanwhile you talk Bernie  [talk bernie - поговорим с берни] into reason.”

He shook her hand and patted her kindly on the shoulder. He looked as if he would have kissed her, with a little encouragement, [little encouragement - небольшое поощрение]  but Valancy did not give it. Not that she would have minded. He was rather dreadful  [rather dreadful - довольно ужасно] and loud—and—and—dreadful. But there was something about him she liked. She thought dully  [thought dully - думал тупо ] that she might have liked being his daughter-in-law if he had not been a millionaire. A score of times over. And Barney was his son—and heir.

She took him over in the motor boat  [motor boat - моторная лодка] and watched the lordly purple car roll away through the woods with Henry at the wheel looking things  [wheel looking things - вещи, похожие на колеса] not lawful to be uttered. Then she went back  [went back - пошли назад] to the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  What she had to do must be done quickly. [done quickly - сделано быстро]  Barney _might_ return at any moment. And it was certainly going  [certainly going - конечно идет] to rain. She was thankful she no longer felt  [longer felt - больше ощущались] very bad. When you are bludgeoned on the head repeatedly, [head repeatedly - неоднократно голова]  you naturally and mercifully become  [mercifully become - к счастью, стали] more or less insensible  [less insensible - менее бесчувственны] and stupid.

She stood briefly like  [stood briefly like - ненадолго постоял, как] a faded flower bitten  [faded flower bitten - увядший цветок укушен] by frost, by the hearth, looking down on the white ashes  [white ashes - белый пепел] of the last fire  [last fire - последний огонь] that had blazed in the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок] 

“At any rate,” she thought wearily, [thought wearily - устало думать]  “Barney isn’t poor. He will be able to afford a divorce. Quite nicely.”



 CHAPTER XXXIX [chapter xxxix - глава xxxix] 

 She must write  [must write - надо писать] a note. The imp in the back of her mind laughed. [mind laughed -  разум смеялся]  In every story  [every story - все истории] she had ever read  [ever read - когда-либо прочитанные] when a runaway wife decamped  [runaway wife decamped - сбежавшая жена сбежала] from home she left a note, generally on the pin-cushion. It was not a very original idea. [original idea - оригинальная идея]  But one had to leave something intelligible. [leave something intelligible - оставить что-то внятное]  What was there to do but write a note? She looked vaguely  [looked vaguely - смотрел неопределенно] about her for something to write with. Ink? There was none. Valancy had never written anything since she had come to the Blue Castle, [blue castle - голубой замок]  save memoranda  [save memoranda - сохранить меморандумы] of household necessaries  [household necessaries - предметы домашнего обихода] for Barney. A pencil sufficed  [pencil sufficed - достаточно карандаша] for them, but now the pencil was not to be found. Valancy absently crossed  [valancy absently crossed - валентность рассеянно перечеркнута] to the door of Bluebeard’s Chamber and tried it. She vaguely expected  [vaguely expected - смутно ожидаемый] to find it locked, but it opened unresistingly. [opened unresistingly - открыл без сопротивления]  She had never tried  [never tried - никогда не пробовал] it before, and did not know whether Barney habitually kept it locked or not. If he did, he must have been badly upset  [badly upset - сильно расстроился] to leave it unlocked. She did not realise that she was doing something he had told her not to do. She was only looking for something to write with. All her faculties were concentrated on deciding just what she would say  [would say - скажет] and how she would say it. There was not the slightest curiosity  [slightest curiosity - малейшее любопытство] in her as she went into the lean-to.

There were no beautiful women hanging  [beautiful women hanging - красивые женщины висят] by their hair on the walls. It seemed a very harmless apartment, [harmless apartment - безвредная квартира]  with a commonplace little sheet- [commonplace little sheet - банальный листочек] iron stove  [iron stove - железная плита] in the middle of it, its pipe sticking  [pipe sticking - торчащая труба] out through the roof. At one end  [one end - один конец] was a table or counter crowded  [counter crowded - прилавок переполнен] with odd-looking utensils. [looking utensils - выглядящая посуда ]  Used no doubt by Barney in his smelly operations. [smelly operations - вонючие операции]  Chemical experiments, [chemical experiments - химические опыты]  probably, she reflected dully. [reflected dully - тускло отражались]  At the other end was a big writing desk  [big writing desk - большой письменный стол] and swivel-chair. The side walls  [side walls - боковые стены] were lined with books.

Valancy went blindly  [valancy went blindly - валэнси пошла вслепую] to the desk. There she stood motionless  [stood motionless - стояла неподвижно] for a few minutes, looking down at something that lay on it. A bundle of galley-proofs. The page on top bore  [top bore - верхняя скважина] the title _Wild Honey_, and under the title were the words “b [words “ - слова «] y John Foster.”

The opening sentence—“Pines are the trees of myth and legend. They strike their roots deep  [roots deep - корни глубокие] into the traditions of an older world, [older world - старый мир]  but wind and star love  [star love - звездная любовь] their lofty tops. [lofty tops - высокие вершины]  What music when old Æolus draws  [old æolus draws - старый Эолус рисует] his bow across  [bow across - лук через] the branches of the pines—” She had heard Barney say  [heard barney say - услышала слова барни] that one day  [one day - однажды] when they walked under them.

So Barney was John Foster! [john foster - джон фостер] 

“So this explains it.”

“It” was a small matter  [small matter - мелкое дело] that had, somehow, stuck in her mind more persistently than its importance seemed  [importance seemed - важность казалась] to justify. Soon after Barney had brought her John Foster’s latest book  [latest book - последняя книга] she had been in a Port Lawrence bookshop  [port lawrence bookshop - книжный магазин порт-лоуренса] and heard a customer ask  [customer ask - покупатель спрашивает] the proprietor for John Foster’s new book. [new book - новая книга]  The proprietor had said curtly, [said curtly - сказал коротко]  “Not out yet. Won’t be out till next week.”

Valancy had opened her lips to say, “Oh, yes, it _is_ out,” but closed them again. After all, it was none of her business. She supposed the proprietor wanted  [proprietor wanted - владелец хотел] to cover up his negligence in not getting the book in promptly. Now she knew. The book Barney  [book barney - книга барни] had given her had been one of the author’s complimentary copies, [complimentary copies - дополнительные экземпляры]  sent in advance.

Well! Valancy pushed  [valancy pushed - валенси толкнул] the proofs indifferently aside  [proofs indifferently aside - корректуры равнодушно в сторону] and sat down in the swivel-chair. She took up Barney’s pen—and a vile one  [vile one - мерзкий] it was—pulled a sheet of paper to her and began to write. She could not think of anything to say except bald facts.

 “Dear Barney:—

I went to Dr. Trent this morning and found out he had sent me the wrong letter  [wrong letter - неправильное письмо] by mistake. There never was anything serious  [anything serious - ничего серьезного] the matter with my heart and I am quite well  [quite well - вполне хорошо] now.

I did not mean to trick you. Please believe  [please believe -  пожалуйста, поверь] that. I could not bear it if you did not believe that. I am very sorry for the mistake. But surely you can get a divorce if I leave you. Is desertion a ground for divorce in Canada? Of course if there is anything I can do to help or hasten it I will do it gladly, if your lawyer will let me know.

I thank you for all your kindness to me. I shall never forget  [shall never forget - никогда не забуду] it. Think as kindly of me as you can, because I did not mean to trap you. Good-bye.

Yours gratefully,

VALANCY.”

 It was very cold and stiff, she knew. But to try to say anything else would be dangerous—like tearing away a dam. She didn’t know what torrent of wild incoherences  [wild incoherences - дикие несоответствия] and passionate anguish might pour out. In a postscript she added:

 “Your father was here today. He is coming back tomorrow. [coming back tomorrow - возвращаюсь завтра]  He told me everything. I think you should go back  [go back - возвращаюсь] to him. He is very lonely for you.”

 She put the letter in an envelope, wrote “Barney” across it, and left it on the desk. On it she laid the string of pearls. If they had been the beads she believed them she would have kept them in memory of that wonderful year. [wonderful year - чудесный год]  But she could not keep the fifteen thousand dollar gift of a man who had married her out of pity and whom she was now leaving. It hurt her to give up her pretty bauble. [pretty bauble - милая безделушка]  That was an odd thing, [odd thing - странная вещь]  she reflected. The fact that she was leaving Barney  [leaving barney - оставляю барни] did not hurt her—yet. It lay at her heart like  [heart like - сердце как] a cold, insensible thing. [insensible thing - бесчувственная вещь]  If it came to life—Valancy shuddered and went out——

She put on her hat and mechanically fed Good Luck and Banjo. She locked the door and carefully hid  [carefully hid - тщательно спрятанный] the key in the old pine. [old pine - старая сосна]  Then she crossed to the mainland in the disappearing propeller. [disappearing propeller - исчезающий пропеллер]  She stood for a moment on the bank, looking at her Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  The rain had not yet come, [yet come - но пришел]  but the sky was dark, and Mistawis grey  [mistawis grey - серая миставис] and sullen. The little house  [little house - маленький домик] under the pines looked  [pines looked - сосны выглядели] very pathetic—a casket rifled  [casket rifled - шкатулка нарезная] of its jewels—a lamp with its flame blown  [flame blown -  взорванное пламя] out.

“I shall never  [shall never - никогда] again hear the wind crying  [wind crying - ветер плачет] over Mistawis at night,” thought Valancy. This hurt her, too. She could have laughed to think that such a trifle could hurt  [trifle could hurt - мелочь могла повредить] her at such a time.



 CHAPTER XL [chapter xl - глава xl] 

 Valancy paused  [valancy paused - валенси остановился] a moment on the porch of the brick house  [brick house - кирпичный дом] in Elm Street. [elm street - улица вязов ]  She felt that she ought to knock like  [knock like - постучим как] a stranger. Her rosebush, she idly noticed, [idly noticed - случайно заметил]  was loaded with buds. The rubber-plant stood beside  [plant stood beside - растение стояло рядом] the prim door. [prim door - чопорная дверь]  A momentary horror overcame  [momentary horror overcame - мгновенный ужас преодолел] her—a horror of the existence to which she was returning. Then she opened the door and walked in.

“I wonder if the Prodigal Son ever felt really at home again,” she thought.

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - двоюродная сестра палочки] were in the sitting-room. Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] was there, too. They looked blankly  [looked blankly - выглядел тупо] at Valancy, realising at once that something was wrong. This was not the saucy, impudent thing  [impudent thing - нахалка] who had laughed at them in this very room last summer. [room last summer - комната прошлым летом]  This was a grey-faced woman  [faced woman - лицоматая женщина] with the eyes of a creature who had been stricken by a mortal blow. [mortal blow - смертельный удар] 

Valancy looked indifferently around the room. She had changed so much—and it had changed so little. The same pictures hung  [pictures hung - висели картины] on the walls. The little orphan  [little orphan - маленький сирота] who knelt at her never-finished prayer  [finished prayer - законченная молитва] by the bed whereon reposed  [bed whereon reposed - кровать, на которой покоился] the black kitten  [black kitten - черный котенок] that never grew  [never grew - никогда не рос] up into a cat. The grey “steel engraving” of Quatre Bras, [quatre bras - quatre bras]  where the British regiment forever stood at bay. The crayon enlargement  [crayon enlargement - увеличение карандашом] of the boyish father  [boyish father - мальчишеский отец] she had never known. [never known - никогда не знал]  There they all hung in the same places. The green cascade  [green cascade - зеленый каскад] of “Wandering Jew” still tumbled out of the old granite saucepan  [old granite saucepan - старая гранитная кастрюля] on the window-stand. The same elaborate, never-used pitcher stood  [used pitcher stood - подержанная подставка для кувшина] at the same angle on the sideboard shelf. [sideboard shelf - полка в буфете]  The blue and gilt vases  [gilt vases - позолоченные вазы] that had been among her mother’s wedding-presents still primly adorned the mantelpiece, flanking the china clock  [china clock - фарфоровые часы] of berosed and besprayed ware  [besprayed ware - забрызганная посуда] that never went. [never went -  никогда не ходил]  The chairs in exactly the same places. Her mother and Cousin Stickles, [cousin stickles - двоюродные палочки]  likewise unchanged, [likewise unchanged - тоже не изменился]  regarding her with stony unwelcome. [stony unwelcome - каменная нежеланная] 

Valancy had to speak first. [speak first - говори первым] 

“I’ve come home, [come home - иди домой ]  Mother,” she said tiredly. [said tiredly - сказал устало] 

“So I see.” Mrs. Frederick’s voice was very icy. She had resigned herself to Valancy’s desertion. She had almost succeeded  [almost succeeded - почти удалось] in forgetting there was a Valancy. She had rearranged and organised her systematic life without  [systematic life without - систематическая жизнь без] any reference to an ungrateful, rebellious child. [rebellious child - непослушный ребенок]  She had taken her place again in a society which ignored the fact that she had ever had a daughter and pitied her, if it pitied her at all, only in discreet whispers  [discreet whispers - сдержанный шепот] and asides. The plain truth  [plain truth - чистую правду] was that, by this time, Mrs. Frederick did not want Valancy  [want valancy - хочу валентности] to come back—did not want ever  [want ever - хочу когда-нибудь] to see or hear of her again.

And now, of course, Valancy was here. With tragedy and disgrace and scandal trailing  [scandal trailing - скандальный шлейф] after her visibly. “So I see,” said Mrs. Frederick. “May I ask why?”

“Because—I’m—not—going to die,” said Valancy huskily.

“God bless my soul!” said Uncle Benjamin. “Who said you were going to die?”

“I suppose,” said Cousin Stickles shrewishly—Cousin Stickles did not want Valancy back either—“I suppose you’ve found out he has another wife—as we’ve been sure all along.”

“No. I only wish he had,” said Valancy. [,” said valancy - , – сказала валэнси]  She was not suffering particularly, [suffering particularly - особенно страдающая]  but she was very tired. If only the explanations were all over and she were upstairs in her old, ugly room—alone. Just alone! The rattle of the beads on her mother’s sleeves, as they swung on the arms of the reed chair, [reed chair - тростниковое кресло]  almost drove  [almost drove - чуть не погнал] her crazy. Nothing else  [nothing else - ничего другого] was worrying her; but all at once it seemed that she simply could  [simply could - просто могла] not endure that thin, insistent rattle. [insistent rattle - настойчивый хрип] 

“My home, as I told you, is always open  [always open - всегда открыта] to you,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs - , — сказала миссис]  Frederick stonily, [frederick stonily - фредерик с каменным видом]  “but I can never forgive  [never forgive - никогда не прощаю] you.”

Valancy gave  [valancy gave - валэнси дала] a mirthless laugh. [mirthless laugh - безрадостный смех] 

“I’d care very little for that if I could only forgive myself,” she said.

“Come, come,” said Uncle Benjamin testily. But rather enjoying  [rather enjoying - скорее наслаждаясь] himself. He felt he had Valancy under his thumb again. “We’ve had enough of mystery. What has happened? Why have you left that fellow? No doubt there’s reason enough—but what particular reason  [particular reason - особая причина] is it?”

Valancy began  [valancy began - валентность началась] to speak mechanically. [speak mechanically - говорить машинально]  She told her tale bluntly  [tale bluntly - сказка прямо] and barely.

“A year ago Dr. [year ago dr - год назад доктор]  Trent told  [trent told - трент не сказал] me I had angina pectoris  [angina pectoris - стенокардия] and could not live long. [live long -  жить долго]  I wanted to have some—life—before I died. That’s why I went away. [went away - ушел]  Why I married Barney. [married barney - женился на барни]  And now I’ve found it is all a mistake. There is nothing wrong  [nothing wrong - ничего плохого] with my heart. I’ve got to live—and Barney only married me out of pity. So I have to leave him—free.”

“God bless me!” said Uncle Benjamin. Cousin Stickles began  [cousin stickles began - кузен Стиклз начал] to cry.

“Valancy, if you’d only had confidence in your own mother——”

“Yes, yes, I know,” said Valancy impatiently. “What’s the use of going into that now? I can’t undo this year. God knows  [god knows - бог знает] I wish I could. I’ve tricked Barney  [tricked barney - обманул Барни] into marrying me—and he’s really Bernard Redfern. [really bernard redfern - на самом деле Бернард Редферн]  Dr. Redfern’s son, of Montreal. And his father wants  [father wants - отец хочет] him to go back  [go back - вернуться] to him.”

Uncle Benjamin made  [uncle benjamin made - дядя бенджамин сделал] a queer sound. [queer sound - странный звук]  Cousin Stickles took  [cousin stickles took - кузен Стиклс забрал] her black-bordered handkerchief away  [bordered handkerchief away - носовой платок в окантовке прочь] from her eyes and stared at Valancy. A queer gleam suddenly shot into Mrs. Frederick’s stone-grey orbs. [grey orbs - серые шары] 

“Dr. Redfern—not the Purple Pill man?” she said.

Valancy nodded. [valancy nodded - валэнси кивнул]  “He’s John Foster, [john foster - джон фостер]  too—the writer of those nature books.”

“Ten times over,” he said.

Valancy nodded. [valancy nodded - вэлэнси кивнула] 

“Yes. Barney left home years ago—because of—of some trouble—some—disappointment. Now he will likely go back. [likely go back - вероятно, вернись]  So you see—I had to come home. [come home - вернись домой]  He doesn’t love me. I can’t hold him to a bond he was tricked into.”

Uncle Benjamin looked incredibly sly.

“Did he say so? Does he want to get rid  [get rid - избавься] of you?”

“No. I haven’t seen him since I found out. But I tell you—he only married me out of pity—because I asked him to—because he thought it would only be for a little while.”

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles  [cousin stickles - кузен стиклс] both tried to speak, but Uncle Benjamin waved  [uncle benjamin waved - дядя бенджамин помахал] a hand at them and frowned portentously. [frowned portentously - значительно нахмурился] 

“Let _me_ handle this,” wave  [,” wave - », машет] and frown seemed  [frown seemed - нахмурился, кажется] to say. To Valancy:

“Well, well, dear, we’ll talk it all over later. You see, we don’t quite understand everything yet. As Cousin Stickles says, [cousin stickles says - кузен стиклс говорит]  you should have confided in us before. Later on—I dare say  [dare say - осмелюсь сказать] we can find a way out of this.”

“You think Barney  [think barney - думаю, барни] can easily get  [easily get - легко заставить] a divorce, don’t you?” said Valancy eagerly.

Uncle Benjamin silenced  [uncle benjamin silenced - дядю бенджамина заставить замолчать] with another wave  [another wave - еще одна волна] the exclamation of horror he knew was trembling on Mrs. Frederick’s lips.

“Trust to me, Valancy. Everything will arrange itself. Tell me this, Dossie. Have you been happy up back? Was Sr.—Mr. Redfern good  [redfern good -  Редферн хорошо] to you?”

“I have been very happy and Barney was very good to me,” said Valancy, [,” said valancy - , – сказала вэлэнси]  as if reciting a lesson. She remembered when she studied grammar  [studied grammar - изучала грамматику] at school she had disliked the past and perfect tenses. [perfect tenses - совершенные времена]  They had always seemed  [always seemed - всегда казалось] so pathetic. “I have been”—it was all over and done with.

“Then don’t worry, little girl.” How amazingly paternal Uncle Benjamin was! “Your family will stand behind  [stand behind - стоять позади] you. We’ll see what can be done.”

“Thank you,” said Valancy dully. Really, it was quite decent  [quite decent - вполне прилично] of Uncle Benjamin. [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин]  “Can I go and lie down a little while? I’m—I’m—tired.”

“Of course you’re tired.” Uncle Benjamin patted her hand gently—very gently. “All worn out and nervous. Go and lie down, by all means. You’ll see things  [see things - видеть вещи] in quite a different light  [different light - другой свет] after you’ve had a good sleep.”

He held the door open. [door open - дверь открыта]  As she went through he whispered, “What is the best way  [best way - лучше всего] to keep a man’s love?”

Valancy smiled wanly. [valancy smiled wanly - валэнси слабо улыбнулась]  But she had come back  [come back - вернись] to the old life—the old shackles. [old shackles - старые кандалы]  “What?” she asked as meekly as of yore.

“Not to return it,” said Uncle Benjamin with a chuckle. He shut the door and rubbed his hands. Nodded and smiled mysteriously round  [smiled mysteriously round - загадочно улыбнулась круглый] the room.

“Poor little Doss!” he said pathetically. [said pathetically - сказал патетически] 

“Do you really suppose  [really suppose - на самом деле предполагает] that—Snaith—can actually be Dr. Redfern’s son?” gasped Mrs. Frederick.

“I see no reason for doubting it. She says Dr. [says dr - говорит доктор]  Redfern has been there; Why, the man is rich as wedding-cake. Amelia, I’ve always believed  [always believed - всегда верили] there was more in Doss than most people thought. [people thought - люди думали]  You kept her down too much—repressed her. She never had a chance to show what was in her. And now she’s landed a millionaire for a husband.”

“But—” hesitated Mrs. [—” hesitated mrs - —» колебалась миссис]  Frederick, “he—he—they told terrible tales  [told terrible tales - рассказывала ужасные истории] about him.”

“All gossip and invention—all gossip and invention. It’s always been a mystery to me why people should be so ready to invent and circulate slanders  [circulate slanders - распространяли клевету] about other people they know absolutely nothing  [know absolutely nothing - абсолютно ничего не знала] about. I can’t understand why you paid so much attention  [much attention - много внимания] to gossip and surmise. Just because he didn’t choose to mix up with everybody, people resented  [people resented - люди возмущались] it. I was surprised to find what a decent fellow  [decent fellow - порядочный парень] he seemed to be that time he came into my store with Valancy. I discounted all the yarns then and there.”

“But he was seen dead drunk  [seen dead drunk - видели мертвецки пьяным] in Port Lawrence  [port lawrence - порт-лоуренс] once,” said Cousin Stickles. Doubtfully, yet as one very willing to be convinced to the contrary.

“Who saw him?” demanded Uncle Benjamin truculently. “Who saw him? Old Jemmy Strang _said_ he saw him. I wouldn’t take old Jemmy Strang’s word on oath. He’s too drunk himself half the time to see straight. [see straight - видите прямо]  He said he saw him lying drunk  [lying drunk - лежу пьяным] on a bench in the Park. Pshaw! Redfern’s been asleep there. Don’t worry over _that_.”

“But his clothes—and that awful old car—” said Mrs. Frederick uncertainly. [frederick uncertainly - фредерик неуверенно] 

“Eccentricities of genius,” declared Uncle Benjamin. “You heard Doss say  [heard doss say - услышал, как Досс сказал] he was John Foster. [john foster - джон Фостер]  I’m not up in literature myself, but I heard a lecturer from Toronto say  [toronto say - торонто сказал] that John Foster’s books had put Canada  [put canada - положи канаду] on the literary map  [literary map - литературную карту] of the world.”

“I—suppose—we must forgive  [must forgive - должен простить] her,” yielded Mrs. [,” yielded mrs - », уступила миссис]  Frederick.

“Forgive her!” Uncle Benjamin snorted. Really, Amelia was an incredibly stupid woman. [incredibly stupid woman - невероятно глупая женщина]  No wonder poor Doss  [wonder poor doss - удивительно, бедная досс] had gone sick  [gone sick - заболела] and tired of living with her. “Well, yes, I think you’d better forgive  [better forgive - лучше простить] her! The question is—will Snaith forgive _us_!”

“What if she persists in leaving him? You’ve no idea how stubborn she can be,” said Mrs. [,” said mrs - », сказала миссис ]  Frederick.

“Leave it all to me, Amelia. Leave it all to me. You women have muddled it enough. This whole affair  [whole affair - все дело] has been bungled from start to finish. If you had put yourself to a little trouble years ago, Amelia, she would not have bolted over the traces as she did. Just let her alone—don’t worry her with advice or questions till  [questions till - вопросы до] she’s ready to talk. She’s evidently run away  [evidently run away - очевидно сбежали] in a panic because she’s afraid he’d be angry with her for fooling him. Most extraordinary thing  [extraordinary thing - необыкновенная вещь] of Trent to tell her such a yarn! That’s what comes of going to strange doctors. [strange doctors - странные врачи]  Well, well, we mustn’t blame her too harshly, poor child. [poor child - бедный ребенок]  Redfern will come after her. If he doesn’t, I’ll hunt him up and talk to him as man to man. He may be a millionaire, but Valancy is a Stirling. He can’t repudiate her just because she was mistaken about her heart disease. [heart disease - болезнь сердца]  Not likely he’ll want to. Doss is a little overstrung. [little overstrung - немного взвинченный]  Bless me, I must get  [must get - надо получить] in the habit of calling her Valancy. She isn’t a baby any longer. Now, remember, Amelia. Be very kind and sympathetic.”

It was something of a large order  [large order - большой заказ] to expect Mrs. [expect mrs - ожидать миссис ]  Frederick to be kind and sympathetic. But she did her best. When supper was ready she went up and asked Valancy  [asked valancy - спрашивал валэнси] if she wouldn’t like a cup of tea. Valancy, lying on her bed, declined. She just wanted to be left alone  [left alone - оставить в покое] for a while. Mrs. Frederick left  [frederick left - фредерик ушел] her alone. She did not even remind Valancy  [even remind valancy - даже напомнить валэнси] that her plight was the outcome of her own lack of daughterly respect  [daughterly respect - дочернее уважение] and obedience. One could  [one could - можно было] not—exactly—say things like that to the daughter-in-law of a millionaire.



 CHAPTER XLI [chapter xli - глава xli] 

 Valancy looked dully  [valancy looked dully - валентность выглядела тускло] about her old room. [old room - старая комната]  It, too, was so exactly the same that it seemed almost impossible  [seemed almost impossible - казалось почти невозможным] to believe in the changes that had come to her since she had last slept  [last slept - последний спал] in it. It seemed—somehow—indecent that it should be so much the same. There was Queen Louise everlastingly coming down the stairway, and nobody had let the forlorn puppy  [forlorn puppy - беспризорный щенок] in out of the rain. Here was the purple paper blind  [purple paper blind - фиолетовая бумажная штора] and the greenish mirror. [greenish mirror - зеленоватое зеркало]  Outside, the old carriage- [old carriage - старая карета] shop with its blatant advertisements. [blatant advertisements - откровенная реклама]  Beyond it, the station with the same derelicts and flirtatious flappers. [flirtatious flappers - кокетливые хлопушки] 

Here the old life waited  [old life waited - старая жизнь ждала] for her, like some grim ogre  [grim ogre - мрачный огр] that bided his time and licked his chops. A monstrous horror  [monstrous horror - чудовищный ужас] of it suddenly possessed  [suddenly possessed - внезапно одержимый ] her. When night fell  [night fell - наступила ночь] and she had undressed and got into bed, the merciful numbness passed away and she lay in anguish and thought of her island under the stars. The camp-fires—all their little household jokes  [little household jokes - маленькие бытовые шутки] and phrases and catch words—their furry beautiful cats—the lights agleam  [lights agleam - мерцание огней] on the fairy islands—canoes skimming over Mistawis in the magic of morning—white birches shining among the dark spruces like beautiful women’s bodies—winter snows and rose-red sunset fires—lakes drunken with moonshine—all the delights of her lost paradise. [lost paradise - потерянный рай]  She would not let herself think of Barney. Only of these lesser things. [lesser things - меньшее]  She could not endure to think of Barney.

Then she thought of him inescapably. She ached for him. She wanted his arms around  [arms around - обнимите руками] her—his face against hers—his whispers in her ear. She recalled all his friendly looks  [friendly looks - дружелюбные взгляды] and quips and jests—his little compliments—his caresses. She counted them all over as a woman might count  [woman might count - женщина может считаться] her jewels—not one did she miss from the first day  [first day - первый день] they had met. These memories were all she could have now. She shut her eyes and prayed.

“Let me remember every one, [remember every one - помните всех]  God! Let me never forget one  [never forget one - никогда не забывайте одну] of them!”

Yet it would be better to forget. This agony of longing and loneliness would  [loneliness would - одиночество будет] not be so terrible if one could forget. [one could forget - можно забыть]  And Ethel Traverse. [ethel traverse - этель траверс]  That shimmering witch woman  [shimmering witch woman - мерцающую женщину-ведьму] with her white skin  [white skin - белая кожа] and black eyes  [black eyes - черные глаза] and shining hair. [shining hair - блестящие волосы]  The woman Barney  [woman barney - женщина барни] had loved. The woman whom he still loved. [still loved - все еще любит]  Hadn’t he told her he never changed  [never changed - никогда не изменял] his mind? Who was waiting for him in Montreal. Who was the right wife  [right wife - правильная жена] for a rich and famous man. [famous man - знаменитый мужчина]  Barney would marry  [barney would marry - барни женится] her, of course, when he got his divorce. How Valancy hated  [valancy hated - валэнси ненавидит] her! And envied her! Barney had said, “I love you,” to _her_. Valancy had wondered what tone Barney would say “I love you” in—how his dark-blue eyes would look when he said it. Ethel Traverse knew. [ethel traverse knew - этель траверс знал]  Valancy hated her for the knowledge—hated and envied her.

“She can never have those hours in the Blue Castle. [blue castle -  синий замок]  They are _mine_,” thought Valancy savagely. Ethel would never make strawberry jam or dance to old Abel’s fiddle or fry bacon  [fry bacon - жарить бекон] for Barney over a camp-fire. She would never come  [would never come - никогда не придет] to the little Mistawis shack  [little mistawis shack - маленькая лачуга миставис] at all.

“Oh, why can’t I die?” moaned Valancy.



 CHAPTER XLII [chapter xlii - глава xlii] 

 It was not until early afternoon  [early afternoon - ранний день] the next day  [next day - на следующий день] that a dreadful old car clanked up Elm Street  [elm street - улица вязов] and stopped in front of the brick house. [brick house - кирпичный дом]  A hatless man sprang  [hatless man sprang - человек без шляпы вскочил] from it and rushed up the steps. The bell was rung as it had never been rung before—vehemently, intensely. The ringer was demanding entrance, [demanding entrance - требовательный вход]  not asking it. Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] chuckled  [uncle benjamin chuckled - дядя бенджамин усмехнулся] as he hurried to the door. Uncle Benjamin had “just dropped in” to enquire how dear Doss—Valancy was. Dear Doss—Valancy, he had been informed, was just the same. She had come down for breakfast—which she didn’t eat—gone back to her room, come down for dinner—which she didn’t eat—gone back to her room. That was all. She had not talked. And she had been let, kindly, considerately, alone.

“Very good. Redfern will be here today,” said Uncle Benjamin. And now Uncle Benjamin’s reputation as a prophet was made. Redfern was here—unmistakably so.

“Is my wife here?” he demanded of Uncle Benjamin without preface.

Uncle Benjamin smiled expressively.

“Mr. Redfern, I believe? Very glad to meet you, sir. Yes, that naughty little girl  [naughty little girl - непослушная маленькая девочка] of yours is here. We have been——”

“I must see  [must see - должен видеть] her,” Barney cut Uncle Benjamin ruthlessly short.

“Certainly, Mr. Redfern. Just step in here. Valancy will be down in a minute.”

He ushered Barney  [ushered barney - провел барни] into the parlour and betook himself to the sitting-room and Mrs. Frederick.

“Go up and tell Valancy  [tell valancy - расскажи Валенси] to come down. Her husband is here.”

But so dubious was Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] as to whether Valancy could really come down in a minute—or at all—that he followed Mrs. [followed mrs - последовал за миссис]  Frederick on tiptoe up the stairs and listened in the hall.

“Valancy dear,” said Mrs. Frederick tenderly, [frederick tenderly - фредерик нежно ]  “your husband is in the parlour, asking for you.”

“Oh, Mother.” Valancy got up from the window and wrung her hands. “I cannot see  [cannot see - не вижу] him—I cannot! Tell him to go away— [go away - уходи] _ask_ him to go away. I can’t see him!”

“Tell her,” hissed Uncle Benjamin through the keyhole, “that Redfern says  [redfern says - редферн говорит] he won’t go away  [go away - уходи] until he _has_ seen her.”

Redfern had not said anything  [said anything - что-нибудь сказала] of the kind, but Uncle Benjamin thought  [uncle benjamin thought - дядя бенджамин подумал] he was that sort of a fellow. Valancy knew  [valancy knew - валэнси знала] he was. She understood that she might as well go  [well go - ну иди] down first as last.

She did not even look  [even look - даже посмотри] at Uncle Benjamin  [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин] as she passed him on the landing. Uncle Benjamin did not mind. Rubbing his hands and chuckling, he retreated to the kitchen, where he genially demanded  [genially demanded - добродушно потребовала] of Cousin Stickles: [cousin stickles - кузен Стиклз] 

“Why are good husbands like bread?”

Cousin Stickles asked  [cousin stickles asked - кузен Стиклс спросил] why.

“Because women need  [women need - женщинам нужно] them,” beamed Uncle Benjamin.

Valancy was looking anything  [looking anything - выглядит как угодно] but beautiful when she entered the parlour. Her white night  [white night - белая ночь] had played fearful havoc  [played fearful havoc - поиграл ужасный хаос] with her face. She wore an ugly old brown- [ugly old brown - уродливый старый коричневый] and-blue gingham, [blue gingham - голубая клетчатая ткань]  having left all her pretty dresses  [pretty dresses - красивые платья] in the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  But Barney dashed across  [barney dashed across - барни промчался] the room and caught her in his arms.

“Valancy, darling—oh, you darling little idiot! [darling little idiot - милый маленький идиот]  Whatever possessed  [whatever possessed - что бы ни обладало] you to run away like  [run away like - убегай, как] that? When I came home last night and found your letter I went quite mad. [went quite mad - сошла с ума]  It was twelve o’clock—I knew it was too late to come here then. I walked the floor all night. Then this morning Dad came—I couldn’t get away till  [get away till - уйди, пока] now. Valancy, whatever got  [whatever got - то, что ушло] into you? Divorce, forsooth! Don’t you know——”

“I know you only married me out of pity,” said Valancy, brushing him away feebly. [away feebly - слабо ушло]  “I know you don’t love me—I know——”

“You’ve been lying awake  [lying awake -  лежа без сна] at three o’clock too long,” said Barney, shaking her. “That’s all that’s the matter with you. Love you! Oh, don’t I love you! My girl, when I saw that train coming  [train coming - приближается поезд] down on you I knew whether  [knew whether - знал,] I loved you or not!”

“Oh, I was afraid you would try  [would try - попробовал бы] to make me think you cared,” cried Valancy passionately. “Don’t—don’t! I _know_. I know all about Ethel Traverse—your father told  [father told - отец сказал] me everything. Oh, Barney, don’t torture me! I can never go back  [never go back - никогда не возвращаться] to you!”

Barney released  [barney released - барни отпустил] her and looked at her for a moment. Something in her pallid, resolute face spoke  [resolute face spoke - решительное лицо говорило] more convincingly than words of her determination.

“Valancy,” he said quietly, [said quietly - сказал тихо]  “Father couldn’t have told you everything because he didn’t know it. Will you let _me_ tell you—everything?”

“Yes,” said Valancy wearily. Oh, how dear he was! How she longed to throw herself into his arms! As he put her gently down in a chair, she could have kissed the slender, brown hands  [brown hands - коричневые руки] that touched her arms. She could not look up as he stood before her. She dared not meet his eyes. For his sake, she must be brave. She knew him—kind, unselfish. Of course he would pretend  [would pretend - притворился бы] he did not want his freedom—she might have known he would pretend that, once the first shock  [first shock - первое потрясение] of realisation was over. He was so sorry for her—he understood her terrible position. [terrible position - ужасное положение]  When had he ever failed  [ever failed - всегда терпел неудачу] to understand? But she would never accept  [would never accept - никогда не принял] his sacrifice. Never!

“You’ve seen Dad  [seen dad - видел папу] and you know I’m Bernard Redfern. [bernard redfern - бернард редферн ]  And I suppose you’ve guessed that I’m John Foster—since you went into Bluebeard’s Chamber.”

“Yes. But I didn’t go in out of curiosity. I forgot you had told me not to go in—I forgot——”

“Never mind. I’m not going to kill you and hang you up on the wall, so there’s no need to call for Sister Anne. [sister anne - сестра энн]  I’m only going to tell you my story from the beginning. I came back last night intending to do it. Yes, I’m ‘old Doc. Redfern’s son’—of Purple Pills  [purple pills - фиолетовые пилюли] and Bitters fame. [bitters fame - горькая слава]  Oh, don’t I know it? Wasn’t it rubbed into me for years?”

Barney laughed bitterly  [barney laughed bitterly - барни горько смеялся] and strode up and down the room a few times. Uncle Benjamin, [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин]  tiptoeing through the hall, heard the laugh and frowned. Surely Doss  [surely doss - конечно, душ] wasn’t going to be a stubborn little fool. [stubborn little fool - упрямый дурак]  Barney threw  [barney threw - барни бросил] himself into a chair before Valancy.

“Yes. As long as I can remember I’ve been a millionaire’s son. But when I was born Dad  [born dad - рожденный папа] wasn’t a millionaire. He wasn’t even a doctor—isn’t yet. He was a veterinary and a failure at it. He and Mother lived  [mother lived - мама жила] in a little village  [little village - маленькая деревня] up in Quebec and were abominably poor. [abominably poor - ужасно бедный]  I don’t remember Mother. [remember mother - помним мать]  Haven’t even a picture of her. She died when I was two years old. [two years old - два года]  She was fifteen years younger  [fifteen years younger - на пятнадцать лет моложе] than Father—a little school teacher. [little school teacher - маленький школьный учитель]  When she died Dad moved  [died dad moved - умер папа, переехал] into Montreal and formed a company to sell his hair tonic. [hair tonic - тоник для волос]  He’d dreamed the prescription one night, [prescription one night - рецепт на одну ночь]  it seems. Well, it caught on. Money began  [money began - деньги начались] to flow in. Dad invented—or dreamed—the other things, too—Pills, Bitters, Liniment and so on. He was a millionaire by the time I was ten, with a house so big a small chap like  [small chap like - маленький парень как] myself always felt lost  [always felt lost - всегда чувствовал себя потерянным ] in it. I had every toy  [every toy - каждая игрушка] a boy could wish  [boy could wish - мальчик мог бы пожелать] for—and I was the loneliest little devil  [loneliest little devil - самый одинокий дьяволенок] in the world. I remember only one happy day  [one happy day - один счастливый день] in my childhood, Valancy. Only one. Even you were better off than that. Dad had gone out to see an old friend  [old friend - старый друг] in the country and took me along. I was turned loose  [turned loose - вырвался на свободу] in the barnyard and I spent the whole day hammering nails in a block of wood. I had a glorious day. [glorious day -  славный день]  When I had to go back  [go back - вернуться] to my roomful of playthings in the big house  [big house - большой дом] in Montreal I cried. But I didn’t tell Dad  [tell dad - рассказать папе] why. I never told  [never told - никогда не говорил] him anything. It’s always been a hard thing  [hard thing - тяжелое дело] for me to tell things, [tell things - рассказать кое-что]  Valancy—anything that went deep. [went deep - пошло глубоко]  And most things went deep  [things went deep - все пошло глубоко] with me. I was a sensitive child  [sensitive child - чувствительный ребенок] and I was even more sensitive as a boy. No one ever knew  [one ever knew - все знали] what I suffered. Dad never dreamed  [dad never dreamed - папа никогда не мечтал] of it.

“When he sent me to a private school—I was only eleven—the boys ducked  [boys ducked - мальчики пригнулись] me in the swimming-tank until I stood on a table and read aloud  [read aloud - читать вслух] all the advertisements of Father’s patent abominations. [patent abominations - патентные мерзости]  I did it—then”—Barney clinched his fists—“I was frightened and half drowned  [half drowned - наполовину утонул] and all my world was against me. But when I went to college and the sophs tried  [sophs tried - софы пытались] the same stunt I didn’t do it.” Barney smiled grimly. “They couldn’t make me do it. But they could—and did—make my life miserable. [life miserable - жизнь жалкая]  I never heard  [never heard - никогда не слышал] the last of the Pills and the Bitters and the Hair Tonic. [hair tonic - тоник для волос]  ‘After using’ was my nickname—you see I’d always such a thick thatch. [thick thatch - толстая солома]  My four college years  [four college years - четыре года в колледже] were a nightmare. You know—or you don’t know—what merciless beasts boys  [merciless beasts boys - беспощадные звери, мальчики] can be when they get a victim like  [victim like - жертва как] me. I had few friends—there was always some barrier between me and the kind of people I cared for. And the other kind—who would have been very willing to be intimate with rich old Doc. [rich old doc - богатый старый доктор]  Redfern’s son—I didn’t care for. But I had one friend—or thought I had. A clever, bookish chap—a bit of a writer. That was a bond between us—I had some secret aspirations along  [secret aspirations along - тайные устремления вдоль] that line. He was older than I was—I looked up to him and worshipped him. For a year I was happier than I’d ever been. Then—a burlesque sketch came  [burlesque sketch came - бурлескный скетч пришли] out in the college magazine—a mordant thing, [mordant thing - едкая штука]  ridiculing Dad’s remedies. The names were changed, of course, but everybody knew  [everybody knew - все знали] what and who was meant. Oh, it was clever—damnably so—and witty. McGill rocked  [mcgill rocked - макгилл потрясла] with laughter over it. I found out _he_ had written it.”

“Oh, were you sure?” Valancy’s dull eyes flamed  [dull eyes flamed - тусклые глаза пылали] with indignation.

Valancy shivered. [valancy shivered - вэланси дрожала]  Barney, his hands stuck  [hands stuck - руки застряли] in his pockets, was regarding the floor moodily  [floor moodily - пол угрюмо] and didn’t notice it.

“Dad told you about her, I suppose. She was very beautiful. And I loved her. Oh, yes, I loved her. I won’t deny it or belittle it now. It was a lonely, romantic boy’s first passionate love, [first passionate love - первая страстная любовь]  and it was very real. And I thought she loved me. I was fool enough  [fool enough - достаточно дурак] to think that. I was wildly happy  [wildly happy - безумно счастлива] when she promised to marry me. For a few months. Then—I found out she didn’t. I was an involuntary eavesdropper  [involuntary eavesdropper - невольный подслушиватель] on a certain occasion  [certain occasion - определенный случай] for a moment. That moment was enough. The proverbial fate  [proverbial fate - пресловутая судьба] of the eavesdropper overtook  [eavesdropper overtook - подслушиватель настиг] me. A girl friend  [girl friend - подруга] of hers was asking her how she could stomach Doc. [could stomach doc - могла переварить дока]  Redfern’s son and the patent-medicine background. [medicine background - медицинский фон] 

“‘His money will gild the Pills and sweeten the Bitters,’ said Ethel, with a laugh. ‘Mother told me to catch him if I could. We’re on the rocks. But pah! I smell turpentine whenever  [smell turpentine whenever - запах скипидара всякий раз] he comes near  [comes near - приближается] me.’”

“Oh, Barney!” cried Valancy, wrung with pity for him. She had forgotten all about herself and was filled with compassion for Barney and rage against Ethel Traverse. [ethel traverse - этель траверс ]  How dared she?

“Well,”—Barney got up and began pacing round  [began pacing round - начали ходить взад-вперед] the room—“that finished me. Completely. I left civilisation  [left civilisation - покинули цивилизацию] and those accursed dopes behind  [accursed dopes behind - проклятые придурки позади] me and went to the Yukon. For five years  [five years - пять лет] I knocked about the world—in all sorts of outlandish places. [outlandish places - диковинные места]  I earned enough  [earned enough - достаточно заработал] to live on—I wouldn’t touch a cent of Dad’s money. Then one day  [one day - однажды] I woke up to the fact that I no longer cared  [longer cared - долго заботились] a hang about Ethel, one way  [one way - в один конец] or another. She was somebody I’d known in another world—that was all. But I had no hankering to go back  [go back - вернитесь назад ] to the old life. [old life - старая жизнь]  None of that for me. I was free and I meant to keep so. I came to Mistawis—saw Tom MacMurray’s island. My first book  [first book - первая книга] had been published the year before, and made a hit—I had a bit of money from my royalties. I bought my island. But I kept away  [kept away - держали подальше] from people. I had no faith in anybody. I didn’t believe there was such a thing as real friendship  [real friendship - настоящая дружба] or true love  [true love - настоящая любовь] in the world—not for me, anyhow—the son of Purple Pills. [purple pills - пурпурные таблетки]  I used to revel in all the wild yarns  [wild yarns - дикие байки] they told of me. In fact, I’m afraid I suggested a few of them myself. By mysterious remarks  [mysterious remarks - загадочные замечания] which people interpreted  [people interpreted - люди интерпретируются] in the light of their own prepossessions.

“Then—you came. I _had_ to believe you loved me—really loved _me_—not my father’s millions. There was no other reason why you should want to marry a penniless devil  [penniless devil - нищий дьявол] with my supposed record. [supposed record - предполагаемый рекорд]  And I was sorry for you. Oh, yes, I don’t deny I married you because I was sorry for you. And then—I found you the best and jolliest and dearest little pal  [dearest little pal - дорогой маленький приятель] and chum a fellow ever  [fellow ever - приятель в жизни] had. Witty—loyal—sweet. You made me believe again in the reality of friendship and love. The world seemed good  [world seemed good - мир казался хорошим] again just because you were in it, honey. I’d have been willing to go on forever just as we were. I knew that, the night I came home  [came home - пришел домой] and saw my homelight shining  [homelight shining - сияние домашнего света] out from the island for the first time. [first time - впервые]  And knew you were there waiting for me. After being homeless all my life it was beautiful to have a home. To come home hungry  [come home hungry - пришел домой голодным] at night and know there was a good supper  [good supper - хороший ужин] and a cheery fire—and _you_.

“But I didn’t realise what you actually meant  [actually meant - на самом деле имел в виду] to me till that moment at the switch. Then it came like  [came like - пришел как] a lightning flash. [lightning flash - вспышка молнии]  I knew I couldn’t live without  [live without - жить без] you—that if I couldn’t pull you loose in time I’d have to die with you. I admit it bowled me over—knocked me silly. I couldn’t get my bearings for a while. That’s why I acted like  [acted like - вел себя как] a mule. But the thought that drove me to the tall timber  [tall timber - высокая древесина] was the awful one  [awful one - ужасно] that you were going to die. I’d always hated  [always hated - всегда ненавидел] the thought of it—but I supposed there wasn’t any chance for you, so I put it out of my mind. Now I had to face it—you were under sentence of death and I couldn’t live without you. When I came home last night I had made up my mind that I’d take you to all the specialists in the world—that something surely could  [something surely could - что-то наверняка могло] be done for you. I felt sure  [felt sure - почувствовал себя уверенным] you couldn’t be as bad as Dr. Trent thought, [trent thought -  трент подумал]  when those moments on the track hadn’t even hurt  [even hurt - даже больно] you. And I found your note—and went mad  [went mad - сойти с ума] with happiness—and a little terror  [little terror - малого ужаса] for fear you didn’t care much  [care much - заботился сильно] for me, after all, and had gone away  [gone away - ушел] to get rid  [get rid - избавился] of me. But now, it’s all right, isn’t it, darling?”

Was she, Valancy being called “darling”?

“I _can’t_ believe you care for me,” she said helplessly. [said helplessly - сказал беспомощно ]  “I _know_ you can’t. What’s the use, Barney? Of course, you’re sorry for me—of course you want to do the best you can to straighten out the mess. But it can’t be straightened out that way. You couldn’t love me—me.” She stood up and pointed tragically  [pointed tragically - трагично указал] to the mirror over the mantel. Certainly, not even Allan Tierney could have seen beauty  [seen beauty - увидел красоту] in the woeful, haggard little face reflected there.

Barney didn’t look at the mirror. He looked at Valancy as if he would like  [would like - хотел бы] to snatch her—or beat her.

“Love you! Girl, you’re in the very core of my heart. I hold you there like a jewel. Didn’t I promise you I’d never tell  [never tell - никогда не говори] you a lie? Love you! I love you with all there is of me to love. Heart, soul, brain. Every fibre  [every fibre - каждой фиброй] of body and spirit thrilling  [spirit thrilling - захватывающий дух] to the sweetness of you. There’s nobody in the world for me but you, Valancy.”

“You’re—a good actor, [good actor - хороший актер]  Barney,” said Valancy, with a wan little smile. [wan little smile - слабая улыбка] 

Barney looked  [barney looked - барни выглядел] at her.

“So you don’t believe me—yet?”

“I—can t.”

“Oh—damn!” said Barney violently.

Valancy looked  [valancy looked - валенси выглядел] up startled. She had never seen _this_ Barney. Scowling! Eyes black  [eyes black - черные глаза] with anger. Sneering lips. [sneering lips - насмешливые губы]  Dead-white face. [white face - белое лицо] 

“You don’t want to believe it,” said Barney  [,” said barney - , – сказал барни] in the silk-smooth voice  [smooth voice - гладкий голос] of ultimate rage. [ultimate rage - предельная ярость]  “You’re tired of me. You want to get out of it—free from me. You’re ashamed of the Pills and the Liniment, just as she was. Your Stirling pride  [stirling pride - стирлингская гордость] can’t stomach them. It was all right as long as you thought you hadn’t long to live. A good lark—you could put  [could put - можно было поставить] up with me. But a lifetime with old Doc Redfern’s son is a different thing. [different thing - другое]  Oh, I understand—perfectly. I’ve been very dense—but I understand, at last.”

Valancy stood  [valancy stood - валэнси встал] up. She stared into his furious face. [furious face - разъяренное лицо]  Then—she suddenly laughed. [suddenly laughed - внезапно засмеялся] 

“You darling!” she said. “You do mean it! You do really love  [really love - на самом деле любовь] me! You wouldn’t be so enraged if you didn’t.”

Barney stared  [barney stared - барни уставился] at her for a moment. Then he caught her in his arms with the little low laugh  [little low laugh - тихий смех] of the triumphant lover. [triumphant lover - торжествующий любовник] 

Uncle Benjamin, [uncle benjamin - дядя бенджамин]  who had been frozen with horror at the keyhole, suddenly thawed  [suddenly thawed - внезапно оттаяло] out and tiptoed back  [tiptoed back - на цыпочках назад] to Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles. [cousin stickles - двоюродный брат стиклс] 

“Everything is all right,” he announced jubilantly. [announced jubilantly - объявил торжествующе] 

Dear little Doss! [dear little doss - дорогой маленькая ночлежка]  He would send  [would send - пошлет] for his lawyer right away  [lawyer right away - адвокат сразу] and alter his will again. Doss should be his sole heiress. [sole heiress - единственная наследница]  To her that had should certainly be given.

Mrs. Frederick, returning to her comfortable belief  [comfortable belief - удобная вера] in an overruling Providence, [overruling providence - преодолевающее провидение]  got out the family Bible  [family bible - семейная библия] and made an entry under “Marriages.”



 CHAPTER XLIII [chapter xliii - глава xliii] 

 “But, Barney,” protested Valancy after a few minutes, “your father—somehow—gave me to understand that you _still_ loved _her_.”

“He would. Dad holds  [dad holds - папа держит] the championship for making blunders. [making blunders - делает грубые ошибки]  If there’s a thing that’s better left unsaid  [better left unsaid - лучше не говорить] you can trust him to say it. But he isn’t a bad old soul, [bad old soul - плохая старая душа]  Valancy. You’ll like him.”

“I do, now.”

“And his money isn’t tainted money. [tainted money - испорченные деньги]  He made it honestly. His medicines are quite harmless. [quite harmless - совершенно безобидные]  Even his Purple Pills  [purple pills - фиолетовые таблетки] do people whole heaps  [people whole heaps - люди целыми кучами] of good when they believe in them.”

“But—I’m not fit for your life,” sighed Valancy. “I’m not—clever—or well-educated—or——”

“My life is in Mistawis—and all the wild places  [wild places - дикие места ] of the world. I’m not going to ask you to live the life of a society woman. [society woman - светская женщина]  Of course, we must spend  [must spend - должна тратить] a bit of the time with Dad—he’s lonely and old——”

“But not in that big house  [big house - большой дом] of his,” pleaded Valancy. [,” pleaded valancy - », – умоляла балдахин]  “I can’t live in a palace.”

“Not lovelier. But a different kind  [different kind - разного рода] of loveliness. There are so many kinds  [many kinds - много видов] of loveliness. Valancy, before this year you’ve spent all your life in ugliness. You know nothing  [know nothing - ничего не знать] of the beauty of the world. We’ll climb mountains—hunt for treasures in the bazaars of Samarcand—search out the magic of east and west—run hand in hand to the rim of the world. I want to show you it all—see it again through your eyes. Girl, there are a million things  [million things - миллион вещей] I want to show you—do with you—say to you. It will take a lifetime. And we must see  [must see - должен видеть] about that picture by Tierney, after all.”

“Will you promise me one thing?” asked Valancy solemnly.

“Anything,” said Barney recklessly.

“Only one thing. [one thing - одна вещь]  You are never, under any circumstances or under any provocation, to cast it up to me that I asked you to marry me.”



 CHAPTER XLIV [chapter xliv - глава xliv] 



 E_xtract from letter written  [letter written - написанное письмо] by Miss Olive Stirling  [miss olive stirling - мисс олив стирлинг] to Mr. Cecil Bruce: [cecil bruce - сесил брюс] _

“It’s really disgusting  [really disgusting - действительно отвратительно] that Doss’ crazy adventures should have turned out like this. It makes one feel  [makes one feel - заставляет чувствовать себя] that there is no use in behaving properly. [behaving properly - вести себя правильно] 

“I’m _sure_ her mind was unbalanced when she left home. [left home - покинул дом]  What she said about a dust-pile showed  [pile showed - кучу показал] that. Of course I don’t think there was ever a thing the matter with her heart. Or perhaps Snaith  [perhaps snaith - возможно, снайт] or Redfern or whatever his name really  [name really - название на самом деле] is fed Purple Pills  [fed purple pills - накормил фиолетовыми таблетками] to her, back in that Mistawis hut  [mistawis hut - миставис хат] and cured her. It would make quite  [would make quite - было бы довольно] a testimonial for the family ads, [family ads - семейные объявления]  wouldn’t it?

“He’s such an insignificent-looking creature. [looking creature - выглядящее существо]  I mentioned this to Doss but all she said was, ‘I don’t like collar ad men.’

“Well, he’s certainly no collar ad man. [collar ad man - ошейник рекламный человек]  Though I must say  [must say - должен сказать] there is something rather distinguished  [something rather distinguished - что-то довольно выдающееся] about him, now that he has cut his hair and put on decent clothes. [decent clothes - приличная одежда]  I really think, [really think - действительно думаю]  Cecil, you should exercise more. It doesn’t do to get too fleshy.

“He also claims, [also claims - также утверждает]  I believe, to be John Foster. [john foster - джон фостер]  We can believe _that_ or not, as we like, I suppose.

“Old Doc Redfern has given them two millions  [two millions - два миллиона] for a wedding-present. Evidently the Purple Pills bring  [purple pills bring - фиолетовые таблетки приносят ] in the bacon. They’re going to spend the fall in Italy and the winter in Egypt and motor through Normandy in apple-blossom time. [blossom time - время цветения]  _Not_ in that dreadful old Lizzie, [dreadful old lizzie - ужасная старая лиззи]  though. Redfern has got a wonderful new car. [wonderful new car - замечательная новая машина] 

“Well, I think I’ll run away, [run away - убегай]  too, and disgrace myself. It seems to pay.

“Uncle Ben is a scream. Likewise Uncle James. [likewise uncle james - тоже дядя джеймс]  The fuss they all make over Doss now is absolutely sickening. [absolutely sickening - абсолютно тошнотворно]  To hear Aunt Amelia talking of ‘my son-in-law, Bernard Redfern’ and ‘my daughter, Mrs. Bernard Redfern.’ Mother and Father are as bad as the rest. And they can’t see that Valancy is just laughing at them all in her sleeve.”



 CHAPTER XLV [chapter xlv - глава xlv] 

 Valancy and Barney turned  [barney turned - барни повернулся] under the mainland pines  [mainland pines -  материковые сосны] in the cool dusk  [cool dusk - прохладные сумерки] of the September night  [september night - сентябрьская ночь] for a farewell look  [farewell look - прощальный взгляд] at the Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]  Mistawis was drowned in sunset lilac light, [sunset lilac light - сиреневый свет заката]  incredibly delicate  [incredibly delicate - невероятно нежно] and elusive. Nip and Tuck were cawing lazily  [cawing lazily - лениво каркая] in the old pines. [old pines - старые сосны]  Good Luck  [good luck - удачи] and Banjo were mewed and mewing in separate baskets  [separate baskets - отдельные корзины] in Barney’s new, dark-green car _en route_ to Cousin Georgiana’ [cousin georgiana - кузина джорджиана] s. Cousin Georgiana was going to take care  [take care - береги] of them until Barney and Valancy came back. [valancy came back - валэнси вернулась]  Aunt Wellington  [aunt wellington - тетя веллингтон] and Cousin Sarah  [cousin sarah - кузина сара] and Aunt Alberta  [aunt alberta - тетя альберта] had also entreated  [also entreated - тоже умоляю] the privilege of looking after them, but to Cousin Georgiana was it given. Valancy was in tears.

“Don’t cry, Moonlight. We’ll be back next summer. [back next summer - вернемся следующим летом]  And now we’re off for a real honeymoon.”

Valancy smiled  [valancy smiled - валэнси улыбнулась] through her tears. She was so happy that her happiness terrified  [happiness terrified - счастье в ужасе] her. But, despite the delights before her—‘the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome’—lure of the ageless Nile—glamour of the Riviera—mosque and palace and minaret—she knew perfectly well  [knew perfectly well - знал прекрасно] that no spot or place or home in the world could ever possess the sorcery of her Blue Castle. [blue castle - голубой замок]
