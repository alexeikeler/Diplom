The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas  With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, [soaring - ширяючий]  the Festival of Summer came to the city Omelas, bright-towered by the sea.

The ringing of the boats in harbor  [harbor - гавань] sparkled with flags.

In the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss- [moss - мох] grown  gardens and under avenues  [avenues - проспекти] of trees, past great parks and public  [public - громадськість] buildings, processions moved.  

Some were decorous: old people in long stiff  [stiff - жорсткий] robes of mauve and gray, grave master  [master - майстер] workmen, [workmen - робітники]  quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked.

In other streets the music beat  [beat - бити] faster, a shimmering of gong  [gong - гонг] and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession  [procession - процесія] was a dance.

Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising  [rising - піднімаючись] like the swallows' crossing flights over the music and the singing.   

All the processions wound  [wound - рана] towards the north side of the city, where on the great water-meadow called the Green Fields boys and girls, naked  [naked - голий] in the bright air, with mud- [mud - грязь] stained  [stained - пофарбований] feet  [feet - ноги] and ankles and long, lithe arms,exercised their restive horses before the race. [race - гонка]    

The horses wore no gear  [gear - спорядження] at all but a halter without bit.

Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green.

They flared their nostrils  [nostrils - ніздрі] and pranced and boasted  [boasted - хвалився] to one another; they were vastly  [vastly - значно] excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted  [adopted - усиновлений] our ceremonies  [ceremonies - церемонії] as his own.   

Far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling Omelas on her bay. [bay - затока] 

The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the Eighteen Peaks burned  [burned - спалений] with white-gold fire across the miles  [miles - миль] of sunlit  [sunlit - освітлений сонцем] air, under the dark blue of the sky.

There was just enough wind to make the banners  [banners - банери] that marked the racecourse  [racecourse - іподром] snap  [snap - знімок] and flutter now and then.   

Joyous!

How is one to tell about joy?

How describe the citizens of Omelas?

They were not simple folk, [folk - народний]  you see, though they were happy.

But we do not say the words of cheer  [cheer - підбадьорювати] much any more.

All smiles have become archaic.

Given a description such as this one tends  [tends - має тенденцію] to make certain assumptions. [assumptions - припущення]    

Given a description such as this one tends  [tends - має тенденцію] to look next for the King, mounted  [mounted - встановлений] on a splendid stallion and surrounded  [surrounded - оточений] by his noble  [noble - шляхетний] knights, or perhaps in a golden  [golden - золотий] litter  [litter - підстилка] borne by great-muscled slaves.

But there was no king.

They did not use swords, [swords - мечі]  or keep slaves.

They were not barbarians, I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I suspect  [suspect - підозрюваний] that they were singularly few.   

As they did without monarchy and slavery, [slavery - рабство]  so they also got on without the stock  [stock - запас] exchange,  the advertisement, the secret  [secret - секрет] police, and the bomb. [bomb - бомба] 

Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk, [folk - народний]   not dulcet shepherds, noble  [noble - шляхетний] savages, bland utopians.

There were not less complex  [complex - складні] than us.  

The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. [stupid - дурний] 

Only pain  [pain - біль] is intellectual, [intellectual - інтелектуальний]  only evil  [evil - зло] interesting.

This is the treason of the artist: [artist - художник]  a refusal  [refusal - відмова] to admit the banality of evil  [evil - зло] and the terrible boredom  [boredom - нудьга] of pain. [pain - біль] 

If you can't lick  [lick - лизати] 'em, join 'em.

If it hurts, repeat it.   

We have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.

How can I tell you about the people of Omelas?

They were not naive  [naive - наївний] and happy children--though their children were, in fact, happy.

They were mature, [mature - зрілий]  intelligent, passionate  [passionate - пристрасний] adults whose lives were not wretched.

O miracle! [miracle - чудо] 

But I wish I could describe it better.   

I wish I could convince  [convince - переконати] you.

Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, [tale - казка]   long ago and far away, once upon a time.

Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own  fancy bids, assuming  [assuming - припускаючи] it will rise  [rise - підніматися] to the occasion, [occasion - нагода] for certainly I cannot suit you all.  

For instance, [instance - екземпляр]  how about technology?

I think that there would be no cars or helicopters  [helicopters - вертольоти] in and above the streets;  this follows from the fact that the people of Omelas are happy people.   

Happiness is based  [based - на основі] on a just discrimination  [discrimination - дискримінація] of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, [destructive - руйнівний]  [destructive - руйнівний]  and what is destructive.

In the middle category, [category - категорія]  however--that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, [comfort - комфорт]  luxury, [luxury - розкіш]  exuberance, [exuberance - буйство]  etc.-they could  perfectly well have central  [central - центральний] heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices  [devices - пристроїв] not yet invented here, floating  [floating - плаваючий] light-sources, fuelless power, a cure  [cure - вилікувати] for the common cold.

Or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter.   

As you like it.

I incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming  to to Omelas during the last days before the Festival on very fast little trains and double-decked trams,  and that the trains station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though plainer than the magnificent  [magnificent - чудовий] Farmers' Market.   

But even granted  [granted - надано] trains, I fear  [fear - страх] that Omelas so far strikes  [strikes - страйки] some of you as goody-goody.  

Smiles, bells, parades, [parades - паради]  horses, bleh.

If so, please add an orgy. [orgy - оргія] 

If an orgy  [orgy - оргія] would help, don't hesitate. [hesitate - вагатися] 

But really it would be better not to have any temples  [temples - храми]  [temples - храми] in Omelas--at least, not manned  [manned - пілотований] temples.

Religion  [Religion - Релігія] yes, clergy no.

Surely  [Surely - Звичайно] the beautiful nudes can just wander  [wander - бродити] about, offering themselves like divine  [divine - божественний] souffles to the hunger  [hunger - голод] of the needy  [needy - нужденний] and the rapture of the flesh. [flesh - плоть] 

Let them join the processions.   

Let tambourines be struck  [struck - вдарив] above the copulations, and the gory of desire  [desire - бажання] be proclaimed  [proclaimed - проголошено] upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant point) let the offspring  [offspring - потомство] of these delightful  [delightful - чудово] rituals  [rituals - ритуали] be beloved and looked after by all.

One thing I know there is none of in Omelas is guilt. [guilt - почуття провини] 

But what else should there be?   

I thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical.

For those who like it, the faint  [faint - непритомніти]  insistent sweetness  [sweetness - солодкість] of drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great  lightness and brilliance  [brilliance - блиск] to the mind and limbs, [limbs - кінцівки]  and then after some hours a dreamy  [dreamy - мрійливий] languor, and wonderful visions  [visions - бачення] at last of the very arcane and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex  [sex - секс] beyond all belief; [belief - переконання]  and it is not habit-forming. [forming - формування] 

For more modest  [modest - скромний] tastes  [tastes - смаки] I think there ought  [ought - повинен] to be beer.

What else, what else belongs in the joyous city?   

A boundless and generous  [generous - щедрий] contentment, a magnanimous triumph  [triumph - тріумфувати] felt not against some outer  [outer - зовнішній] enemy  [enemy - ворог] but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls  [souls - душі] of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's summer: This is what swells  [swells - набрякає] the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the victory  [victory - перемога] they celebrate is that of life.

I don't think many of them need to take drooz.  

Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now.

A marvelous smell of cooking goes forth  [forth - вперед] from the red and blue tents  [tents - намети] of the provisioners.

The faces of small children are amiably sticky; [sticky - липкий]  in the benign  [benign - доброякісний] gray beard  [beard - борода] of a man a couple of crumbs  [crumbs - крихти] of rich pastry  [pastry - випічка] are entangled.

The youths and girls have mounted  [mounted - встановлений] their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course.

An old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, [basket - кошик]  and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair.   

A child of nine or ten sits at the edge  [edge - краю] of the crowd alone, playing on a wooden flute. [flute - флейта] 

People pause  [pause - пауза] to listen, and they smile, [smile - усмішка]  but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases  [ceases - припиняється] playing and never sees them, his dark eyes wholly  [wholly - цілком] rapt in the sweet, thing magic of the tune.

He finishes, and slowly lowers  [lowers - знижує] his hands holding the wooden flute. [flute - флейта]   

As if that little private silence were the signal, [signal - сигнал]  all at once a trumpet  [trumpet - труба] sounds from the pavilion near the starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing.

The horses rear on their slender legs, and some of them neigh in answer.   

Sober-faced, the young riders  [riders - вершники] stroke  [stroke - інсульт] the horses' necks and soothe  [soothe - заспокоювати] them, whispering. [whispering - шепіт] 

"Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope..."

The Festival of Summer has begun.  

Do you believe?

Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy?

No?

Then let me describe one more thing.

In a basement  [basement - підвал] under one of the beautiful public  [public - громадськість] buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar  [cellar - льох] of one of its spacious  [spacious - просторий] private homes, there is a room.

It has one locked  [locked - заблокований] door, and no window.   

A little light seeps in dustily between cracks  [cracks - тріщини] in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar. [cellar - льох] 

In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff, [stiff - жорсткий]  clotted, foul-smelling  [smelling - запах] heads, stand near a rusty  [rusty - іржавий] bucket.

The floor is dirt, [dirt - бруд]  [dirt - бруд]  a little damp  [damp - вологий] to the touch, as cellar  [cellar - льох] dirt usually is.  

The room is about three paces  [paces - кроків] long and two wide: a mere  [mere - просто] broom  [broom - віник] closet or disused tool room.

In the room, a child is sitting.

It could be a boy or a girl.

It looks about six, but actually is nearly ten.

It is feeble-minded. [minded - налаштований] 

Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. [neglect - нехтування] 

It picks its nose and occasionally  [occasionally - час від часу] fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops.   

It is afraid of the mops.

It finds them horrible. [horrible - жахливий] 

It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still standing there; and the door is locked; [locked - заблокований]  and nobody will come.

The door is always locked; [locked - заблокований]  and nobody ever comes, except that sometimes--the child has no understanding  [understanding - розуміння] of time or interval- [interval - інтервал] -sometimes the door rattles terribly  [terribly - жахливо] and opens, and a person, or several people, are there.

One of them may come in and kick the child to make it stand up.

The others never come close, but peer  [peer - ровесник] in at it with frightened, disgusted  [disgusted - огидний] eyes.   

The food bowl and the water jug  [jug - глечик] are hastily  [hastily - поспішно] filled, the door is locked; [locked - заблокований]  the eyes disappear.  

The people at the door never say anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can remember sunlight and its mother's voice, sometimes speaks.

"I will be good, " it says.

"Please let me out.

I will be good!"

They never answer.

It is naked. [naked - голий] 

Its buttocks and thighs  [thighs - стегна] are a mass  [mass - маса] of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually. [continually - постійно]   

They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas.

Some of them have come to see it, others are content  [content - вміст] merely  [merely - просто] to know it is there.

They all know that it has to be there.

Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness  [tenderness - ніжність] of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom  [wisdom - мудрість] of their scholars, [scholars - вчені]  the skill of their makers, even the abundance  [abundance - достаток] of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly  [wholly - цілком] on this child's abominable misery. [misery - нещастя]   

This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they seem capable  [capable - здатний] of understanding; [understanding - розуміння]  and most of those who come to see the child are young people, though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child.

No matter how well the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators  [spectators - глядачів] are always shocked  [shocked - шокований] and sickened at the sight.

They feel disgust, [disgust - огида]  which they had thought themselves superior  [superior - начальника] to.   

They feel anger, [anger - гнів]  outrage, [outrage - обурення]  impotence, [impotence - імпотенція]  despite  [despite - незважаючи на] all the explanations.

They would like to do something for the child.

But there is nothing they can do.

If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed  [fed - годували] and comforted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity  [prosperity - процвітання] and beauty and delight  [delight - захоплення] of Omelas would wither  [wither - в'янути] and be destroyed.

Those are the terms. [terms - умови]    

Often the young people go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, [rage - лють]  when they have seen the child and faced this terrible paradox. [paradox - парадокс]    

They may brood over it for weeks or years.

But as time goes on they begin to realize that even if the child could be released, [released - звільнений]   it would not get much good of its freedom: a little vague  [vague - розпливчастий] pleasure of warmth  [warmth - тепло] and food, no real doubt, but little more.  

It is too degraded and imbecile to know any real joy.

It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear.  

Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond  [respond - відповісти] to humane  [humane - гуманний] treatment. [treatment - лікування] 

Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without walls about it to protect  [protect - захистити] it, and darkness  [darkness - темрява] for its eyes, and its own excrement to sit in.  

Their tears at the bitter  [bitter - гіркий] injustice  [justice - справедливість]  [injustice - несправедливість] dry when they begin to perceive  [perceive - сприймати] the terrible justice of reality, [reality - реальність]  and to accept it.

Yet it is their tears and anger, [anger - гнів]  the trying of their generosity  [generosity - щедрість] and the acceptance  [acceptance - прийняття] of their helplessness, [helplessness - безпорадність]  which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives.

Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible  [irresponsible - безвідповідальний] happiness.

They know that they, like the child, are not free.

They know compassion. [compassion - співчуття]    

It is the existence  [existence - існування]  [existence - існування] of the child, and their knowledge of its existence, that makes possible the nobility  [nobility - дворянство] of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity of their science.

It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children.   

They know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the flute- [flute - флейта] player, could make no joyful music as the young riders  [riders - вершники] line  [line - лінія] up in their beauty for the race  [race - гонка] in the sunlight of the first morning of summer.  

Now do you believe them?

Are they not more credible? [credible - достовірний] 

But there is one more thing to tell, and this is quite incredible. [incredible - неймовірно] 

At times one of the adolescent  [adolescent - підліток] girls or boys who go see the child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all.  

Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman.  

Night falls; the traveler  [traveler - мандрівник] must pass down village streets, between the houses with yellow- lit windows, and on out into the darkness  [darkness - темрява] of the fields.

Each alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains.

They go on.

They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, [darkness - темрява]  and they do not come back.   

The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness.

I cannot describe it at all.

It is possible that it does not exist.

But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.
