The Ones Who Walk  [Walk - Прогулка] Away  [Away - Вдали] From Omelas   With a clamor of bells  [bells - колокольчики] that set  [set - набор] the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came  [came - пришел] to the city  [city - город] Omelas, bright-towered by the sea. [sea - море] 

The ringing of the boats  [boats - лодки] in harbor sparkled with flags. [flags - флаги] 

Some were decorous: old  [old - старые] people  [people - люди] in long  [long - длинные] stiff robes of mauve and gray, grave master workmen, quiet, [quiet - тихие]  merry  [merry - веселые] women  [women - женщины] carrying  [carrying - несущие] their babies  [babies - малышей] and chatting as they walked. [walked - гуляли] 

All the processions wound towards the north side of the city, [city - город]  where on the great  [great - большой] water- [water - вода] meadow called the Green Fields boys  [boys - мальчики] and girls, [girls - девочки]  naked in the bright  [bright - яркий] air, with mud-stained feet and ankles and long, lithe arms, [arms - руки] exercised  [exercised - упражняются] their restive horses  [horses - лошади] before the race.   

The horses  [horses - лошади] wore  [wore - носил] no gear at all but a halter without bit.

Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green. [green - зеленый] 

They flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly excited, [excited - возбужденный]  the horse  [horse - лошадь] being the only animal  [animal - животное] who has adopted our ceremonies as his own.   

The air of morning  [morning - утро] was so clear that the snow  [snow - снег] still crowning the Eighteen  [Eighteen - 18] Peaks burned with white- [white - белый] gold fire  [fire - огонь] across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark  [dark - темный] blue  [blue - синий] of the sky. [sky - небо] 

There was just enough wind  [wind - ветер] to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then.   

Joyous!

How is one to tell  [tell - рассказать] about joy?

How describe  [describe - описать] the citizens of Omelas?

They were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. [happy - счастливый] 

But we do not say the words  [words - слова] of cheer much any more.

All smiles  [smiles - улыбки] have become archaic.

Given  [Given - Дано] a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions.   

Given  [Given - Дано] a description such as this one tends to look  [look - взгляд] next for the King, mounted on a splendid  [splendid - великолепно] stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a golden litter borne by great- [great - великолепно] muscled slaves.

But there was no king. [king - король] 

They did not use  [use - использовать] swords, or keep slaves.

They were not barbarians, I do not know  [know - знать] the rules  [rules - правила] and laws of their society, but I suspect that they were singularly few.   

As they did without monarchy and slavery, so they also got  [got - получил] on without the stock exchange,  the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb.

Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. [interesting - интересно] 

This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible  [terrible - ужасно] boredom of pain.

If you can't lick 'em, ['em - больно]  ['em - с ними]  join  [join - присоединяйтесь к ним] 'em.

If it hurts, [hurts - повторяйте]  repeat  [repeat - удерживайте] it.   

But to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold  [hold - удерживайте] of everything else.  

We have almost lost hold; [hold - опишите]  we can no longer describe  [describe - счастливый] happy  [happy - мужчина] man, [man - праздник]  nor make any celebration  [celebration - расскажите] of joy.

How can I tell  [tell - люди] you about the people  [people - счастливые] of Omelas?

They were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose lives  [lives - живет] were not wretched.

O miracle!

But I wish I could describe  [describe - описывать] it better. [better - лучше]    

I wish I could convince you.

Omelas sounds in my words  [words - слова] like  [like - как] a city  [city - город] in a fairy  [fairy - фея] tale,  long ago  [ago - назад] and far away, [away - вдали]  once upon a time. [time - время] 

Perhaps it would be best  [best - лучшее] if you imagined  [imagined - воображаемое] it as your own  fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion,for certainly I cannot suit you all.  

For instance, how about technology? [technology - технологии] 

Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive.

In the middle  [middle - средний] category, however--that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, etc.-they could  perfectly well have central heating, subway  [subway - метро] trains, [trains - поезда]  washing machines, [machines - машины]  and all kinds  [kinds - виды] of marvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light- [light - свет] sources, fuelless power, a cure for the common cold. [cold - холодный] 

Or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter.   

As you like  [like - как] it.

But even granted trains, [trains - поезда]  I fear that Omelas so far strikes some of you as goody-goody.  

Smiles, [Smiles - Улыбки]  bells, [bells - колокольчики]  parades, horses, [horses - кони]  bleh.

If so, please add  [add - добавить] an orgy.

If an orgy would help, [help - помощь]  don't hesitate.

Let  [Let - Давай] us not, however, have temples from which issue beautiful  [beautiful - красиво] nude priests and priestesses already  [ready - готово] half in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man  [man - мужчина] or woman, [woman - женщина]  lover or stranger, who desires union with the deep godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea. [idea - идея]    

But really it would be better  [better - лучше] not to have any temples in Omelas--at least, not manned temples.

Religion yes, [yes - да]  clergy no.

Let  [let - пусть]  [Let - Пусть] tambourines be struck above the copulations, and the gory of desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant point) [point - точка]  let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved and looked  [looked - посмотрел] after by all.

One thing  [thing - вещь] I know  [know - знать] there is none of in Omelas is guilt.

But what else should there be?   

I thought  [thought - думал] at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical.

For more modest tastes I think  [think - думаю] there ought to be beer.

What else, what else belongs in the joyous city? [city - город]    

The sense of victory, surely, the celebration  [celebration - праздник] of courage.

But as we did without clergy, let  [let - пусть] us do without soldiers.

The joy built  [built - построен] upon successful  [successful - удачный] slaughter is not the right  [right - правильный] kind  [kind - добрый] of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial.   

I don't think  [think - думаю] many of them need to take drooz.  

Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now.

A marvelous smell  [smell - запах] of cooking goes  [goes - идет] forth from the red  [red - красный] and blue  [blue - синий] tents of the provisioners.

The faces  [faces - лица] of small  [small - маленькие] children  [children - дети] are amiably sticky; in the benign gray beard of a man  [man - мужчины] a couple of crumbs of rich  [rich - богатые] pastry are entangled.

A child  [child - ребенок] of nine or ten sits  [sits - сидит] at the edge of the crowd alone, playing  [playing - играет] on a wooden flute.

People pause to listen, [listen - слушает]  and they smile, but they do not speak  [speak - говорит] to him, for he never ceases playing  [playing - играет] and never sees  [sees - видит] them, his dark  [dark - темно] eyes  [eyes - глаза] wholly rapt in the sweet, [sweet - сладкое]  thing  [thing - дело] magic of the tune.

He finishes, [finishes - заканчивает]  and slowly lowers his hands  [hands - руки] holding the wooden flute.  

Sober-faced, the young  [young - молодые] riders stroke the horses' [horses - кони]  necks  [necks - шеи] and soothe them, whispering.

"Quiet, [quiet - тихо]  [Quiet - Тихо]  quiet, there my beauty, my hope. [hope - надежда] .."

They begin  [begin - начало] to form in rank along the starting line. [line - линия] 

The crowds along the racecourse are like  [like - вроде] a field  [field - поле] of grass  [grass - трава] and flowers  [flowers - цветы] in the wind. [wind - ветер] 

The Festival of Summer has begun. [begun - начало]   

Do you believe? [believe - верю] 

No?

Then let  [let - давай] me describe  [describe - опиши] one more thing. [thing - вещь] 

In a basement under one of the beautiful  [beautiful - красивое] public buildings  [buildings - здания] of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar of one of its spacious private homes, [homes - дома]  there is a room. [room - комната] 

It has one locked door, [door - дверь]  and no window. [window - окно]    

A little  [little - маленький] light  [light - свет] seeps in dustily between cracks in the boards, [boards - доски]  secondhand from a cobwebbed window  [window - окно] somewhere across the cellar.

The floor  [floor - пол] is dirt, a little  [little - маленький] damp to the touch, [touch - касание]  as cellar dirt usually  [usually - обычно] is.  

The room  [room - комната]  [room - комната] is about three paces long  [long - длинный] and two wide: a mere broom closet  [closet - шкаф] or disused tool  [tool - инструмент] room.

In the room, [room - комната]  a child  [child - ребенок] is sitting. [sitting - сидит] 

It could be a boy  [boy - мальчик] or a girl. [girl - девочка] 

It looks  [looks - смотрит] about six, but actually is nearly ten.

It is feeble-minded.

Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect.

It is afraid  [afraid - боится] of the mops.

It finds  [finds - находит] them horrible.

It shuts its eyes, [eyes - глаза]  but it knows  [knows - знает] the mops are still standing there; and the door  [door - дверь] is locked; and nobody will come. [come - приходит] 

The door  [door - дверь]  [door - дверь] is always locked; and nobody ever comes, [comes - приходит]  except that sometimes [time - время] --the child  [child - ребенок] has no understanding of time or interval--sometimes the door rattles terribly and opens, [opens - открывает]  and a person, [person - человек]  or several people, [people - люди]  are there.

The others never come  [come - приди] close, [close - закрой]  but peer in at it with frightened, disgusted eyes. [eyes - глаза]    

The food  [food - еда] bowl  [bowl - миска] and the water  [water - вода] jug are hastily filled, [filled - наполнил]  the door  [door - дверь] is locked; the eyes  [eyes - глаза] disappear.  

"I will be good, [good - хороший]  " it says. [says - говорит] 

"Please let  [let - пусть] me out.

I will be good! [good - хороший] "

They never answer. [answer - ответ] 

The child  [child - ребенок] used to scream for help at night, [night - ночь]  and cry a good  [good - хороший] deal, but now it only makes  [makes - делает] a kind  [kind - добрый] of whining, "eh-haa, eh-haa," and it speaks  [speaks - говорит] less and less often.  

It is naked.

Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores, as it sits  [sits - сидит] in its own excrement continually.  

They all know  [know - знаю] it is there, all the people  [people - люди] of Omelas.

Some of them have come  [come - приходите] to see it, others are content merely to know  [know - знаете] it is there.

They all know  [know - знаете] that it has to be there.

Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, [city - город]  the tenderness of their friendships, the health  [health - здоровье] of their childr [child - ребенок] en, [children - дети]  the wisdom of their scholars, the skill  [skill - навыки] of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers  [weathers - погода] of their skies, [skies - небо]  depend wholly on this child's abominable misery.  

No matter  [matter - материя] how well the matter has been explained to them, these young  [young - молодой] spectators are always shocked and sickened at the sight. [sight - взгляд] 

They feel  [feel - чувствовать] disgust, which they had thought  [thought - мысль] themselves superior to.   

They feel  [feel - чувствовать] anger, outrage, impotence, despite all the explanations.

They would like  [like - как] to do something for the child. [child - ребенок] 

But there is nothing they can do.

The terms are strict  [strict - строгий] and absolute; there may not even be a kind word  [word - слово] spoken  [spoken - произнесенный] to the child. [child - ребенок] 

Often the young  [young - молодой] people  [people - люди] go home in tears, or in a tearless rage, when they have seen  [seen - увиденный] the child  [child - ребенок] and faced this terrible  [terrible - ужасный] paradox.   

They may brood over it for weeks  [weeks - недели] or years. [years - годы] 

It is too degraded and imbecile to know  [know - знать] any real  [real - настоящий] joy.

It has been afraid  [afraid - боится] too long ever to be free  [free - свободный] of fear.  

Its habits  [habits - привычки] are too uncouth for it to respond to humane treatment.

Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without walls  [walls - стены] about it to protect it, and darkness for its eyes, [eyes - глаза]  and its own excrement to sit  [sit - сидеть] in.  

Their tears at the bitter injustice dry  [dry - сухой] when they begin  [begin - начинать] to perceive the terrible  [terrible - ужасно] justice of reality, and to accept it.

Yet it is their tears and anger, the trying of their generosity and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true  [true - правда] source of the splendor of their lives. [lives - живет] 

Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible happiness.

They know  [know - знать] compassion.   

It is the existence of the child, [child - ребенок]  and their knowledge of its existence, that makes  [makes - делает] possible the nobility of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, [music - музыку]  the profundity of their science. [science - науку] 

It is because of the child  [child - ребенок] that they are so gentle with children. [children - дети]    

They know  [know - знать] that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, [dark - темный]  the other one, the flute-player, [player - игрок]  could make no joyful music  [music - музыка] as the young  [young - молодой] riders line up in their beauty for the race in the sunlight of the first morning  [morning - утро] of summer. [summer - лето]   

Now do you believe  [believe - верить] them?

Are they not more credible?

At times  [times - раз] one of the adolescent girls  [girls - девочки] or boys  [boys - мальчики] who go see the child  [child - ребенок] does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all.  

Sometimes also a man  [man - мужчина] or a woman  [woman - женщина] much older  [older - старше] falls silent for a day  [day - день] or two, then leaves  [leaves - листья] home.

These people  [people - люди] go out into the street, [street - улица]  [street - улица]  and walk  [walk - прогулка] down the street alone.

They keep walking  [walking - гуляет] across the farmlands of Omelas.

Each one goes  [goes - идет] alone, youth or girl, [girl - девушка]  man  [man - мужчина] or woman. [woman - женщина]   

Night falls; the traveler must pass down village streets, [streets - улицы]  between the houses  [houses - дома] with yellow- lit windows, [windows - окна]  and on out into the darkness of the fields. [fields - поля] 

Each alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains. [mountains - горы] 

They go on.

They leave  [leave - уходят] Omelas, they walk  [walk - гуляют] ahead into the darkness, and they do not come  [come - приходят] back.   

I cannot describe  [describe - описать] it at all.

It is possible that it does not exist.

But they seem to know  [know - знать] where they are going, [going - уйти]  the ones who walk  [walk - уйти] away  [away - уйти] from Omelas.
