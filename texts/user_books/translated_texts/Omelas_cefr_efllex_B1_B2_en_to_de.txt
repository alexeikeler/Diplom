The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas   With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the Festival of Summer came to the city Omelas, bright-towered by the sea.

The ringing of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags.

In the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss- [moss - Moos] grown  gardens and under avenues  [avenues - Alleen] of trees, past great parks and public  [public - Öffentlich] buildings, processions moved.  

Some were decorous: old people in long stiff  [stiff - steif] robes of mauve and gray, grave master  [master - Meister] workmen, [workmen - Arbeiter]  quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked.

In other streets the music beat  [beat - schlagen] faster, a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession was a dance.

Children dodged in and out, their high calls rising  [rising - steigend] like the swallows' crossing flights over the music and the singing.   

All the processions wound  [wound - verwundet] towards the north side of the city, where on the great water-meadow called the Green Fields boys and girls, naked  [naked - nackt] in the bright air, with mud- [mud - Schlamm] stained  [stained - befleckt] feet  [feet - Füße] and ankles and long, lithe arms,exercised their restive horses before the race. [race - Rennen]    

The horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit.

Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green.

They flared their nostrils  [nostrils - Nüstern] and pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly  [vastly - weitgehend] excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted  [adopted - angenommene] our ceremonies  [ceremonies - Zeremonien] as his own.   

Far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling Omelas on her bay.

The air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the Eighteen Peaks burned  [burned - verbrannte] with white-gold fire across the miles  [miles - Meilen] of sunlit  [sunlit - sonnenbeschienen] air, under the dark blue of the sky.

There was just enough wind to make the banners that marked the racecourse  [racecourse - Rennbahn] snap and flutter now and then.   

In the silence of the broad  [broad - breit] green meadows one could hear the music winding  [winding - gewunden] throughout the city streets, farther and nearer  [nearer - näher] and ever approaching, [approaching -  nähernd]  a cheerful  [cheerful - fröhlich] faint  [faint - schwach] sweetness  [sweetness - süß] of the air from time to time trembled  [trembled - zitternd] and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells.  

Joyous!

How is one to tell about joy?

How describe the citizens of Omelas?

They were not simple folk, [folk - volk]  you see, though they were happy.

Given a description such as this one tends  [tends - tendiert] to look next for the King, mounted  [mounted - montiert] on a splendid stallion and surrounded  [surrounded - umgeben] by his noble knights, or perhaps in a golden  [golden - golden] litter  [litter - verdächtig] borne by great-muscled slaves.

But there was no king.

They did not use swords, or keep slaves.

They were not barbarians, I do not know the rules and laws of their society, but I suspect  [suspect - stock] that they were singularly few.   

As they did without monarchy and slavery, so they also got on without the stock  [stock - geheim] exchange,  the advertisement, the secret  [secret - bombe] police, and the bomb. [bomb - folk] 

Yet I repeat that these were not simple folk, [folk - komplex]   not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians.

There were not less complex  [complex - dumm] than us.  

The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. [stupid - schmerz] 

Only pain  [pain - intellektuell] is intellectual, [intellectual - böse]  only evil  [evil - künstler] interesting.

This is the treason of the artist: [artist - böse]  a refusal to admit the banality of evil  [evil - langeweile] and the terrible boredom  [boredom - schmerz] of pain. [pain - lecken] 

If you can't lick  [lick - lob] 'em, join 'em.

If it hurts, repeat it.   

But to praise  [praise - verzweiflung] despair  [despair - freude] is to condemn delight, [delight - umarmung]  to embrace  [embrace - gewalt] violence  [violence -  reif] is to lose hold of everything else.  

We have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy.

How can I tell you about the people of Omelas?

They were not naive and happy children--though their children were, in fact, happy.

They were mature, [mature - leidenschaftlich]  intelligent, passionate  [passionate - überzeugend] adults whose lives were not wretched.

O miracle!

But I wish I could describe it better.   

I wish I could convince  [convince - erzählt] you.

Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, [tale - angenommen]   long ago and far away, once upon a time.

I think that there would be no cars or helicopters  [helicopters - Hubschrauber] in and above the streets;  this follows from the fact that the people of Omelas are happy people.   

Happiness is based  [based - basiert] on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive.

In the middle category, [category - Kategorie]  however--that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, [comfort - Komfort]  luxury, [luxury - Luxus]  exuberance, etc.-they could  perfectly well have central  [central - zentrale] heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices  [devices - Geräte] not yet invented here, floating  [floating - schwebend] light-sources, fuelless power, a cure  [cure - heilen] for the common cold.

Or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter.   

As you like it.

I incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming  to to Omelas during the last days before the Festival on very fast little trains and double-decked trams,  and that the trains station of Omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though plainer than the magnificent  [magnificent - großartig] Farmers' Market.   

But even granted  [granted - gewährt] trains, I fear  [fear - Angst] that Omelas so far strikes  [strikes - Streiks] some of you as goody-goody.  

Smiles, bells, parades, [parades - Paraden]  horses, bleh.

If so, please add an orgy.

If an orgy would help, don't hesitate. [hesitate - Zögern] 

Let us not, however, have temples  [temples - Tempel] from which issue  [issue - Problem] beautiful nude priests  [priests - Priester] and priestesses already half  [half - halb] in ecstasy  [ecstasy - Ekstase] and ready to copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires  [desires - Wünsche] union  [union - Union] with the deep  [deep - tief] godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea.   

But really it would be better not to have any temples  [temples - Tempel]  [temples - Tempel] in Omelas--at least, not manned temples.

Religion  [Religion -  Religion] yes, clergy no.

Surely  [Surely - Sicherlich] the beautiful nudes can just wander  [wander - wandern] about, offering themselves like divine souffles to the hunger  [hunger - hungrig] of the needy  [needy - bedürftig] and the rapture of the flesh.

Let them join the processions.   

One thing I know there is none of in Omelas is guilt.

But what else should there be?   

I thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical.

For those who like it, the faint  [faint - Ohnmacht]  insistent sweetness  [sweetness - Süße] of drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great  lightness and brilliance  [brilliance - Brillanz] to the mind and limbs, and then after some hours a dreamy  [dreamy - verträumt] languor, and wonderful visions  [visions - Visionen] at last of the very arcane and inmost secrets of the Universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex  [sex - Sex] beyond all belief; [belief - Glaube]  and it is not habit-forming. [forming - bildend] 

For more modest  [modest - bescheiden] tastes  [tastes - Geschmäcker] I think there ought  [ought - sollte] to be beer.

What else, what else belongs in the joyous city?   

The sense of victory, [victory - Sieg]  surely, [surely - gewiss]  the celebration of courage. [courage - Mut] 

But as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers.

The joy built upon successful slaughter  [slaughter - Gemetzel] is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. [trivial - trivial]    

A boundless and generous  [generous - großzügig] contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer  [outer - äußerer] enemy  [enemy - Feind] but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls  [souls - Seelen] of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's summer: This is what swells  [swells - schwellen] the hearts of the people of Omelas, and the victory  [victory - Sieg] they celebrate is that of life.

I don't think many of them need to take drooz.  

Most of the processions have reached the Green Fields by now.

A marvelous smell of cooking goes forth from the red and blue tents  [tents - Zelte] of the provisioners.

The faces of small children are amiably sticky; [sticky - klebrig]  in the benign gray beard  [beard - Bart] of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry  [pastry -  Gebäck] are entangled.

The youths and girls have mounted  [mounted - montierter] their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course.

An old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, [basket - Korb]  and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair.   

A child of nine or ten sits at the edge  [edge - Rand] of the crowd alone, playing on a wooden flute. [flute - Flöte] 

As if that little private silence were the signal, [signal - Signal]  all at once a trumpet  [trumpet - Trompete] sounds from the pavilion near the starting line: imperious, melancholy, piercing.

The horses rear on their slender legs, and some of them neigh in answer.   

Sober-faced, the young riders  [riders - Reiter] stroke  [stroke - Streich] the horses' necks and soothe  [soothe - beruhigen] them, whispering. [whispering - flüstern] 

"Quiet, quiet, there my beauty, my hope..."

They begin to form  [form - Form] in rank  [rank - Rang] along the starting line.

The crowds along the racecourse  [racecourse - Rennbahn] are like a field of grass and flowers in the wind.

The Festival of Summer has begun.  

Do you believe?

Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy?

No?

Then let me describe one more thing.

In a basement  [basement - Keller] under one of the beautiful public  [public - öffentlich] buildings of Omelas, or perhaps in the cellar  [cellar - Keller] of one of its spacious private homes, there is a room.

It has one locked  [locked - verschlossen] door, and no window.   

A little light seeps in dustily between cracks  [cracks - Risse] in the boards, secondhand from a cobwebbed window somewhere across the cellar. [cellar - Keller] 

In one corner of the little room a couple of mops, with stiff, [stiff - steif]  clotted, foul-smelling  [smelling - riechend] heads, stand near a rusty  [rusty - rostig] bucket.

The floor is dirt, [dirt - Schmutz]  [dirt - Schmutz]  a little damp  [damp - feucht] to the touch, as cellar  [cellar - Keller] dirt usually is.  

The room is about three paces  [paces - Schritte] long and two wide: a mere broom  [broom - Besen] closet or disused tool room.

In the room, a child is sitting.

It could be a boy or a girl.

It looks about six, but actually is nearly ten.

It is feeble-minded. [minded - gesinnt] 

Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition, and neglect. [neglect -  Vernachlässigung] 

It picks its nose and occasionally  [occasionally - gelegentlich] fumbles vaguely with its toes or genitals, as it sits hunched in the corner farthest from the bucket and the two mops.   

It is afraid of the mops.

It finds them horrible. [horrible - schrecklich] 

It shuts its eyes, but it knows the mops are still standing there; and the door is locked; [locked - gesperrt]  and nobody will come.

One of them may come in and kick the child to make it stand up.

The others never come close, but peer  [peer - Peer] in at it with frightened, disgusted  [disgusted - ekelhaft] eyes.   

The food bowl and the water jug  [jug - Krug] are hastily  [hastily - hastig] filled, the door is locked; [locked - gesperrt]  the eyes disappear.  

The people at the door never say anything, but the child, who has not always lived in the tool room, and can remember sunlight and its mother's voice, sometimes speaks.

"I will be good, " it says.

"Please let me out.

I will be good!"

They never answer.

The child used to scream  [scream - schreiend] for help at night, and cry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining, "eh-haa, eh-haa," and it speaks less and less often.  

It is so thin there are no calves  [calves - Waden] to its legs; its belly protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a day.

It is naked. [naked - nackt] 

Its buttocks and thighs  [thighs - Oberschenkel] are a mass  [mass - Masse] of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually.  

They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas.

Some of them have come to see it, others are content  [content - zufrieden] merely to know it is there.

They all know that it has to be there.

Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness  [tenderness - Zärtlichkeit] of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom  [wisdom - Weisheit] of their scholars, [scholars - Gelehrte]  the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child's abominable misery.  

This is usually explained to children when they are between eight and twelve, whenever they seem capable  [capable - fähig] of understanding; [understanding - verständnisvoll]  and most of those who come to see the child are young people, though often enough an adult comes, or comes back, to see the child.

No matter how well the matter has been explained to them, these young spectators  [spectators - Zuschauer] are always shocked  [shocked - schockiert] and sickened at the sight.

They feel disgust, [disgust - Ekel]  which they had thought themselves superior to.   

They feel anger, [anger - Wut]  outrage, [outrage - Empörung]  impotence, [impotence - Impotenz]  despite  [despite - trotz] all the explanations.

They would like to do something for the child.

But there is nothing they can do.

If the child were brought up into the sunlight out of that vile place, if it were cleaned and fed  [fed - genährt] and comforted, that would be a good thing, indeed; but if it were done, in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight  [delight - Freude] of Omelas would wither  [wither -  verdorren] and be destroyed.

Those are the terms. [terms - Begriffe]    

To exchange  [exchange - Austausch] all the goodness  [goodness - Güte] and grace of every life in Omelas for that single, small improvement: [improvement - Verbesserung]  to throw away the happiness of thousands for the chance of happiness of one: that would be to let guilt within the walls indeed.

They may brood over it for weeks or years.

But as time goes on they begin to realize that even if the child could be released, [released - befreit]   it would not get much good of its freedom: a little vague pleasure of warmth  [warmth - Wärme] and food, no real doubt, but little more.  

It is too degraded and imbecile to know any real joy.

It has been afraid too long ever to be free of fear.  

Its habits are too uncouth for it to respond  [respond - reagieren] to humane  [humane - menschlich] treatment. [treatment - Behandlung] 

Indeed, after so long it would probably be wretched without walls about it to protect  [protect - schützen] it, and darkness  [darkness - Dunkelheit] for its eyes, and its own excrement to sit in.  

Their tears at the bitter  [bitter - bitter] injustice  [justice - Gerechtigkeit] dry when they begin to perceive  [perceive - wahrnehmen] the terrible justice of reality, [reality - Realität]  and to accept it.

Yet it is their tears and anger, [anger - Wut]  the trying of their generosity  [generosity - Großzügigkeit] and the acceptance of their helplessness, which are perhaps the true source of the splendor of their lives.

Theirs is no vapid, irresponsible  [irresponsible - unverantwortlich] happiness.

They know that they, like the child, are not free.

They know compassion.   

It is the existence  [existence - Existenz]  [existence - Existenz] of the child, and their knowledge of its existence, that makes possible the nobility  [nobility - Adel] of their architecture, the poignancy of their music, the profundity of their science.

It is because of the child that they are so gentle with children.   

They know that if the wretched one were not there sniveling in the dark, the other one, the flute- [flute - Flöte] player, could make no joyful music as the young riders  [riders - Reiter] line  [line - Linie] up in their beauty for the race  [race - Rasse] in the sunlight of the first morning of summer.  

Now do you believe them?

Are they not more credible?

But there is one more thing to tell, and this is quite incredible. [incredible - unglaublich] 

At times one of the adolescent girls or boys who go see the child does not go home to weep or rage, does not, in fact, go home at all.  

Sometimes also a man or a woman much older falls silent  [silent - still] for a day or two, then leaves home.

These people go out into the street, and walk down the street alone.

They keep walking, and walk straight out of the city of Omelas, through the beautiful gates.

They keep walking across the farmlands  [farmlands - Ackerland] of Omelas.

Each one goes alone, youth or girl, man or woman.  

Night falls; the traveler  [traveler - Reisender] must pass down village streets, between the houses with yellow- lit windows, and on out into the darkness  [darkness -  Dunkelheit] of the fields.

Each alone, they go west or north, towards the mountains.

They go on.

They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, [darkness - Dunkelheit]  and they do not come back.   

The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness.

I cannot describe it at all.

It is possible that it does not exist.

But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.
