If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole life would have been entirely different.

She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, [clan - клан]  to Aunt Wellington’s engagement  [engagement - помолвка] picnic and Dr. Trent would have gone to Montreal.

But it did rain and you shall hear what happened to her because of it.  

Valancy wakened early, in the lifeless, [lifeless - безжизненный]  hopeless hour just preceding  [preceding - предшествующий] dawn. [dawn - рассвет] 

She had not slept very well.

One does not sleep well, sometimes, when one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community  [community - сообщество] and connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to get a man.  

Deerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless old maidenhood.

But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished  [relinquished - покинутый] a certain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance  [Romance - романтика] would come her way yet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the fact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.  

Ay, _there_ lay the sting.

Valancy did not mind so much being an old maid.

After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as dreadful  [dreadful - ужасный] as being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin, or even an Uncle Herbert.

What hurt her was that she had never had a chance to be anything but an old maid.

No man had ever desired  [desired - желанный] her.  

The tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly  [faintly - слабо] greying darkness. [darkness - тьма] 

She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two reasons.

She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain around the heart.

She had had a spell  [spell - заклинание] of it after she had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet.

And she was afraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at her with minute, persistent, [persistent - настойчивый]  mosquito-like questions regarding the cause  [cause - причина] thereof.  

But of course appearances should be kept up.

“It is not,” Valancy could hear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, [asserting - утверждающий]  “it is not _maidenly_ to think about _men_.”  

The thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a sense of humour  [humour - юмор] nobody in her clan  [clan - клан] suspected. [suspected - подозреваемый] 

For that matter, there were a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. [suspected - подозреваемый] 

But her laughter was very superficial  [superficial - поверхностный] and presently  [presently - в настоящее время] she lay there, a huddled, futile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and watching, with a sick distaste, the chill, [chill - холод]  merciless light creeping  [creeping - ползучий] into her ugly, sordid room.  

She knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it.

There were only two pictures that were not of relatives.

One, an old chromo of a puppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. [doorstep - порог] 

That picture always made Valancy unhappy.

That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep  [doorstep - порог] in the driving rain!

Why didn’t _some one_ open the door and let him in?

The other picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise coming down a stairway, [stairway - лестница]  which Aunt Wellington had lavishly given her on her tenth birthday.

For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated it, beautiful, smug, [smug - самодовольный]  self-satisfied Queen Louise.

But she never dared  [dared - смеется] destroy it or remove it.

Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been aghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would have had a fit. [fit - подходит]   

Every room in the house was ugly, of course.

But downstairs appearances were kept up somewhat. [somewhat - несколько] 

There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw.

Valancy sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room herself, even without money, if she were permitted.

But her mother had negatived every timid  [timid - робкий] suggestion and Valancy did not persist. [persist - настойчивый] 

Valancy never persisted. [persisted - настойчивый] 

She was afraid to.

Her mother could not brook opposition.

Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if offended, [offended - обиженный]  with the airs of an insulted duchess.  

The only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone there at night to cry if she wanted to.  

But, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for nothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly?

Valancy was never permitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose.

People who wanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles believed, could only want to be alone for some sinister  [sinister - зловещий] purpose.

But her room in the Blue Castle was everything a room should be.  

Valancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life, was wont to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams.

Nobody in the Stirling clan, [clan - клан]  or its ramifications, suspected  [suspected - подозревается] this, least of all her mother and Cousin Stickles.

They never knew that Valancy had two homes—the ugly red brick  [brick - кирпич] box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue Castle in Spain.

Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever since she could remember.

She had been a very tiny child when she found herself possessed of it.

Everything wonderful and beautiful was in that castle.

Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight  [moonlight - лунный свет] and fire; couches of roses  [roses - розы] and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps, with great, white urns, and with slender, mist- [mist - туман] clad maidens going up and down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell and nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that reflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest of all, for whose glance men died.

All that supported her through the boredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night.

Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they had known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.  

For one thing she had quite a few lovers in it.

Oh, only one at a time.

One who wooed  [wooed - сватались] her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry and won her after long devotion and many deeds  [deeds - деяния] of derring-do, and was wedded  [wedded - поженились] to her with pomp and circumstance  [circumstance - обстоятельство] in the great, banner- [banner - знамя] hung chapel of the Blue Castle.  

At twelve, this lover was a fair lad  [lad - парень] with golden  [golden - золотые] curls  [curls - кудри] and heavenly blue eyes.

At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still necessarily  [necessarily - необходимо] handsome.

At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, [dreamy - мечтательный]  spiritual.

At twenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, [jaw - челюсть]  slightly grim, [grim - мрачный]  and a face strong and rugged rather than handsome.

I don’t say Valancy deliberately  [deliberately - нарочито] murdered these lovers as she outgrew  [outgrew - перерос] them.

One simply faded  [faded - блек] away as another came.

Things are very convenient in this respect in Blue Castles.  

But, on this morning of her day of fate, [fate - судьба]  Valancy could not find the key of her Blue Castle.

Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking  [barking - лающий] at her heels like a maddening little dog.

She was twenty-nine, lonely, undesired, ill-favoured—the only homely  [homely - некрасивый] girl in a handsome clan, [clan - клан]  with no past and no future.

As far as she could look back, life was drab and colourless, [colourless - бесцветный]  with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere.

As far as she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until she was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging  [clinging - цепляющийся] to a wintry bough.

The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to live for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the bitterness of death.  

“And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop.

I may have to live eighty years,” thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. [panic - паника] 

“We’re all horribly long-lived.

It sickens me to think of it.”  

She was glad it was raining—or rather, she was drearily satisfied that it was raining.

There would be no picnic that day.

This annual picnic, whereby Aunt and Uncle Wellington—one always thought of them in that succession— [succession - преемственность] inevitably  [inevitably - неизбежно] celebrated their engagement  [engagement - помолвка] at a picnic thirty years before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare  [nightmare - кошмар] to Valancy.

There seemed to be nothing of the revolutionary in her nature.

And she knew exactly what every one would say to her at the picnic.

Uncle Wellington, whom she disliked and despised  [despised - презираемый] even though he had fulfilled  [fulfilled - исполненный] the highest Stirling aspiration, [aspiration - стремление]  “marrying money,” would say to her in a pig’s whisper, “Not thinking of getting married yet, my dear? [dear - дорогой] ” and then go off into the bellow of laughter with which he invariably  [invariably - неизменно] concluded his dull  [dull - скучный] remarks. [remarks - замечания] 

Aunt Wellington, of whom Valancy stood in abject awe, would tell her about Olive’s new chiffon dress and Cecil’s last devoted  [devoted - преданный] letter.

Valancy would have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter had been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. [offended - обиженный] 

And Valancy had long ago decided that she would rather offend  [offend - обиженный] God than Aunt Wellington, because God might forgive her but Aunt Wellington never would.  

Aunt Alberta, enormously  [enormously - безмерно] fat, with an amiable habit of always referring to her husband as “he,” as if he were the only male creature in the world, who could never forget that she had been a great beauty in her youth, would condole with Valancy on her sallow skin—  “I don’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned.

When _I_ was a girl my skin was roses  [roses - розы] and cream.

I was counted the prettiest girl in Canada, my dear. [dear - дорогой] ”  

Perhaps Uncle Herbert wouldn’t say anything—or perhaps he would remark jocularly, “How fat you’re getting, Doss!”

And then everybody would laugh over the excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little Doss getting fat.  

And Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between wheezy chuckles, and answer them himself.  

“What is the difference between Doss and a mouse?  

“The mouse wishes to harm the cheese and Doss wishes to charm  [charm - обаяние] the he’s.”  

Valancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she wanted to throw something at him.

But she never did.

In the first place, the Stirlings simply did not throw things; in the second place, Uncle Benjamin was a wealthy  [wealthy - богатый] and childless  [childless - бездетный] old widower  [widower - вдовец] and Valancy had been brought up in the fear and admonition of his money.

If she offended  [offended - обиженный] him he would cut her out of his will—supposing she were in it.

Valancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin’s will.

She had been poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it.

So she endured  [endured - перетерпевший] his riddles  [riddles - загадки] and even smiled tortured  [tortured - истязаемый] little smiles over them.  

Aunt Isabel, downright and disagreeable  [disagreeable - неприятный] as an east wind, would criticise her in some way—Valancy could not predict just how, for Aunt Isabel never repeated a criticism— [criticism - критика] she found something new with which to jab you every time.

Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she thought, but didn’t like it so well when other people said what _they_ thought to _her_.

Valancy never said what _she_ thought.  

Cousin Georgiana—named after her great-great-grand- [grand - грандиозный] mother, who had been named after George the Fourth—would recount dolorously the names of all relatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder “which of us will be the first to go next.”  

Oppressively competent, [competent - компетентный]  Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly  [endlessly - бесконечно] of her husband and her odious prodigies of babies to Valancy, because Valancy would be the only one she could find to put up with it.

For the same reason, Cousin Gladys—really First Cousin Gladys once removed, according to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated relationship—a tall, thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive  [sensitive - чувствительный] disposition, [disposition - нрав]  would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis.

There would be none of all this today.

And there would be no packing up of teaspoons. [teaspoons - чайные ложки] 

The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin Stickles.

And once, six years ago, a silver teaspoon  [teaspoon - чайная ложка] from Aunt Wellington’s wedding set had been lost.

Valancy never heard the last of that silver teaspoon. [teaspoon - чайная ложка] 

Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every subsequent  [subsequent - последующие] family feast.  

Oh, yes, Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she blessed  [blessed - благословенные] the rain that had saved her from it.

There would be no picnic this year.

If Aunt Wellington could not celebrate on the sacred  [sacred - священные] day itself she would have no celebration at all.

Thank whatever gods  [gods - боги] there were for that.  

Since there would be no picnic, Valancy made up her mind that, if the rain held up in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get another of John Foster’s books.

Valancy was never allowed to read novels, but John Foster’s books were not novels.

They were “nature books”—so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling—“all about the woods and birds and bugs  [bugs - жуки] and things like that, you know.”

So Valancy was allowed to read them—under protest, for it was only too evident  [evident - очевидные] that she enjoyed them too much.

It was permissible, even laudable, to read to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was enjoyable  [enjoyable - приятные] was dangerous.

Valancy did not know whether her mind was being improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across John Foster’s books years ago life might have been a different thing for her.

They seemed to her to yield  [yield - урожай] glimpses  [glimpses - проблески] of a world into which she might once have entered, though the door was forever barred to her now.

It was only within the last year that John Foster’s books had been in the Deerwood library, though the librarian told Valancy that he had been a well-known writer for several years.  

“Where does he live?”

Valancy had asked.  

“Nobody knows.

From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more information can be had.

His publishers won’t say a word.

Quite likely John Foster is a nom de plume.

His books are so popular we can’t keep them in at all, though I really can’t see what people find in them to rave over.”  

“I think they’re wonderful,” said Valancy, timidly.  

“Oh—well—” Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising  [patronising - покровительственно] fashion that relegated Valancy’s opinions to limbo, “I can’t say I care much for bugs  [bugs - жуки] myself.

But certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.”  

Valancy didn’t know whether she cared much for bugs  [bugs - жуки] either.

It was not John Foster’s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that enthralled her.

Yes, she would get a new Foster book.

It was a month since she had _Thistle Harvest_, so surely Mother could not object. [object - объект] 

Valancy had read it four times—she knew whole passages off by heart.  

And—she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer pain around the heart.

It had come rather often lately, [lately - в последнее время]  and the palpitations were becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional  [occasional - случайный] dizzy moment and a queer  [queer - странный] shortness  [shortness - краткость] of breath.

But could she go to see him without telling any one?

It was a most daring  [daring - дерзкий] thought.

None of the Stirlings ever consulted  [consulted - посоветовался] a doctor without holding a family council and getting Uncle James’ approval.

_

Then_, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh of Port Lawrence, who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling.  

But Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh.

And, besides, she could not get to Port Lawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there.

She did not want any one to know about her heart.

There would be such a fuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it over and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible tales of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “just like that” and “dropped dead without a moment’s warning, my dear. [dear - дорогой] ”  

Aunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a girl who would have heart trouble—“so pinched and peaked always”; and Uncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult, [insult - оскорбление]  when “no Stirling ever had heart disease before”; and Georgiana would forebode in perfectly audible asides that “poor, dear little Doss isn’t long for this world, I’m afraid”; and Cousin Gladys would say, “Why, _my_ heart has been like that for _years_,” in a tone that implied  [implied - подразумеваемый] no one else had any business even to have a heart; and Olive—Olive would merely  [merely - просто] look beautiful and superior  [superior - превосходный] and disgustingly  [disgustingly - отвратительно] healthy, as if to say, “Why all this fuss over a faded  [faded - выцветший] superfluity like Doss when you have _me_?”  

Valancy felt that she couldn’t tell anybody unless she had to.

Dr. Trent was over seventy and there had been rumours  [rumours - слухи] that he meant to retire soon.

None of the Stirling clan  [clan - клан] had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten years before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed it.

You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted  [insulted - оскорбленный] your first-cousin—once-removed like that—not to mention that he was a Presbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church.

But Valancy, between the devil  [devil - дьявол]  [devil - дьявол] of disloyalty to clan  [clan - клан] and the deep  [deep - глубокий] sea of fuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take a chance with the devil.     

CHAPTER II   When Cousin Stickles knocked at her door, Valancy knew it was half-past seven and she must get up.

As long as she could remember, Cousin Stickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven.

Cousin Stickles and Mrs. Frederick Stirling had been up since seven, but Valancy was allowed to lie abed half an hour longer because of a family tradition that she was delicate. [delicate - деликатный] 

Valancy got up, though she hated getting up more this morning than ever she had before.

What was there to get up for?

Another dreary day like all the days that had preceded  [preceded - предшествующий] it, full of meaningless  [meaningless - бессмысленный] little tasks, joyless and unimportant, that benefited  [benefited - выгодный] nobody.

But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for breakfast at eight o’clock.

Hard and fast times for meals were the rule in Mrs. Stirling’s household.

Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper at six, year in and year out.

No excuses for being late were ever tolerated. [tolerated - терпимый] 

So up Valancy got, shivering.  

The room was bitterly  [bitterly - горько] cold with the raw, penetrating  [penetrating - проникающий] chill  [chill - холод] of a wet May morning.

The house would be cold all day.

It was one of Mrs. Frederick’s rules that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth of May.

On the twenty-first of October Mrs. Frederick began cooking over the kitchen range and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the evenings.

It was whispered  [whispered - прошептал] about in the connection that the late Frederick Stirling had caught the cold which resulted in his death during Valancy’s first year of life because Mrs. Frederick would not have a fire on the twentieth of October.

She lighted it the next day—but that was a day too late for Frederick Stirling.  

Valancy took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse, [coarse - грубо]  unbleached cotton, with high neck and long, tight sleeves.

She put on undergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick, black stockings and rubber-heeled boots.

Of late years she had fallen into the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the looking-glass pulled down.

The lines on her face did not show so plainly  [plainly - прямо] then.

But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and looked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate  [passionate - страстно] determination  [determination - решительно] to see herself as the world saw her.  

The result was rather dreadful. [dreadful - ужасно] 

Even a beauty would have found that harsh, [harsh - резко]  unsoftened side-light trying.

Valancy saw straight black hair, short and thin, always lustreless despite  [despite - несмотря на] the fact that she gave it one hundred strokes  [strokes - поглаживания] of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her life and faithfully rubbed  [rubbed - потер] Redfern’s Hair Vigor into the roots, more lustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black brows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her small, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell open a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and flat- [flat - плоско] breasted, rather below the average height.

She had somehow escaped the family high cheek- [cheek - щеку] bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and shadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. [Oriental - восточное] 

Apart from her eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly—just insignificant-looking, she concluded bitterly. [bitterly - горько] 

How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth were in that merciless light!

And never had her narrow, white face looked so narrow and so white.  

She did her hair in a pompadour.

Pompadours had long gone out of fashion, but they had been in when Valancy first put her hair up and Aunt Wellington had decided that she must always wear her hair so.  

“It is the _only_ way that becomes you.

But then, there were so many things Valancy never dared  [dared - осмелился] do.  

All her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly. [bitterly - горько] 

From the very dawn  [dawn - рассвет] of recollection, [recollection - воспоминание]  when she had been so horribly afraid of the big black bear that lived, so Cousin Stickles told her, in the closet under the stairs.  

“And I always will be—I know it—I can’t help it.

I don’t know what it would be like not to be afraid of something.”  

Afraid of her mother’s sulky fits—afraid of offending  [offending - оскорбление]  [offending - оскорбление] Uncle Benjamin—afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Wellington’s contempt— [contempt - презрение] afraid of Aunt Isabel’s biting comments—afraid of Uncle James’ disapproval— [disapproval - неодобрение] afraid of offending the whole clan’ [clan - род] s opinions and prejudices— [prejudices - предубеждения] afraid of not keeping up appearances—afraid to say what she really thought of  anything—afraid of poverty in her old age.

Fear—fear—fear—she could never escape from it.

It bound  [bound - связанный] her and enmeshed her like a spider’s web of steel.

Only in her Blue Castle could she find temporary release.

And this morning Valancy could not believe she had a Blue Castle.

She would never be able to find it again.

Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired—what had she to do with the fairy-like chatelaine of the Blue Castle?

She would cut such childish  [childish - ребячество] nonsense  [nonsense - бред] out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly.  

She turned from her unfriendly mirror and looked out.

Valancy _had_ kept her schoolgirl complexion. [complexion - цвет лица] 

That was just the trouble.

There was not a gleam  [gleam - блеск] of beauty anywhere—“exactly like my life,” thought Valancy drearily.

Her brief bitterness had passed.

She accepted facts as resignedly as she had always accepted them.

She was one of the people whom life always passes by.

There was no altering  [altering - изменяющийся] that fact.  

In this mood Valancy went down to breakfast.     

CHAPTER III   Breakfast was always the same.

Oatmeal porridge, which Valancy loathed, toast and tea, and one teaspoonful  [teaspoonful - чайная ложка] of marmalade.

Mrs. Frederick thought two teaspoonfuls extravagant—but that did not matter to Valancy, who hated marmalade, too.

The chilly, [chilly - зябкий]  gloomy  [gloomy - мрачный] little dining-room was chillier and gloomier  [gloomier - мрачнее] than usual; the rain streamed down outside the window; departed  [departed - ушедший] Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, wider than the pictures, glowered down from the walls.

And yet Cousin Stickles wished Valancy many happy returns of the day!  

“Sit up straight, Doss,” was all her mother said.  

Valancy sat up straight.

She talked to her mother and Cousin Stickles of the things they always talked of.

She never wondered what would happen if she tried to talk of something else.

She knew.

Therefore she never did it.  

Mrs. Frederick was offended  [offended - обиженный] with Providence for sending a rainy day when she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky silence for which Valancy was rather grateful.

But Christine Stickles whined endlessly  [endlessly - бесконечно] on as usual, complaining about everything—the weather, the leak  [leak - протекающий] in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter—Valancy felt at once she had buttered her toast too lavishly—the epidemic  [epidemic - эпидемический] of mumps in Deerwood.  

“Doss will be sure to ketch them,” she foreboded.  

“Doss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,” said Mrs. Frederick shortly. [shortly - коротко]   

Valancy had never had mumps—or whooping cough— [cough - кашель] or chicken-pox—or measles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds every winter.

Doss’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the family.

Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them.

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles did their heroic best.

“The Stirlings seldom  [seldom - редко] take colds,” said Cousin Stickles resentfully.

_

She_ had been a Stirling.  

“I think,” said Mrs. Frederick, “that if a person makes up her mind _not_ to have colds she will not _have_ colds.”  

So that was the trouble.

It was all Valancy’s own fault.  

But on this particular  [particular - особый] morning Valancy’s unbearable  [unbearable - невыносимый] grievance was that she was called Doss.

She had endured [endure - терпящий]   [endured - переносимый] it for twenty-nine years, and all at once she felt she could not endure it any longer.

Her full name was Valancy Jane.

Valancy Jane was rather terrible, but she liked Valancy, with its odd, [odd - странный]  out-land tang.

It was always a wonder to Valancy that the Stirlings had allowed her to be so christened.

She had been told that her maternal  [maternal - материнский] grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for her.

Her father had tacked  [tacked - прикрепленный] on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the whole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss.

She never got Valancy from any one but outsiders. [outsiders - посторонние]   

“Mother,” she said timidly, “would you mind calling me Valancy after this?

Doss seems so—so—I don’t like it.”  

Mrs. Frederick looked at her daughter in astonishment. [astonishment - удивление] 

She wore glasses with enormously  [enormously - чрезвычайно] strong lenses that gave her eyes a peculiarly disagreeable  [disagreeable - неприятный] appearance.  

“What is the matter with Doss?”  “It—seems so childish, [childish - ребяческий] ” faltered  [faltered - нерешительный] Valancy.  

“Oh!”

Mrs. Frederick had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile was not an asset. [asset - актив] 

“I see.

Well, it should suit _you_

then.

“I am twenty-nine,” said the dear child desperately. [desperately - отчаянно]   

“I wouldn’t proclaim  [proclaim - провозглашать] it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,” said Mrs. Frederick.

“Twenty-nine!

_

I_ had been married nine years when I was twenty-nine.”  

“_I_ was married at seventeen,” said Cousin Stickles proudly. [proudly - гордо]   

Valancy looked at them furtively.

Mrs. Frederick, except for those terrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a parrot than a parrot itself could look, was not ill-looking.

At twenty she might have been quite pretty.

But Cousin Stickles!

And yet Christine Stickles had once been desirable  [desirable - желанное] in some man’s eyes.

Valancy felt that Cousin Stickles, with her broad, flat, wrinkled  [wrinkled - морщинистое]  [wrinkled - морщинистое] face, a mole right on the end of her dumpy nose, bristling hairs on her chin, wrinkled yellow neck, pale, protruding eyes, and thin, puckered mouth, had yet this advantage over her—this right to look down on her.

And even yet Cousin Stickles was necessary to Mrs. Frederick.

Valancy wondered pitifully what it would be like to be wanted by some one—needed by some one.

No one in the whole world needed her, or would miss anything from life if she dropped suddenly out of it.

She was a disappointment  [disappointment - разочарование] to her mother.

No one loved her.

She had never so much as had a girl friend.  

“I haven’t even a gift for friendship,” she had once admitted to herself pitifully.  

“Doss, you haven’t eaten your crusts,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.  

It rained all the forenoon without cessation. [cessation - прекращение] 

Valancy pieced a quilt.

Valancy hated piecing quilts.

And there was no need  [need - нужда] of it.

The house was full of quilts.

There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in the attic. [attic - чердак] 

Mrs. Frederick had begun storing  [storing - хранение]  [storing - хранение] away  [away - прочь] quilts when Valancy was seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem likely that Valancy would ever need them.

But Valancy must be at work and fancy work materials were too expensive.

Idleness was a cardinal sin  [sin - грех] in the Stirling household.

When Valancy had been a child she had been made to write down every night, in a small, hated, black notebook, [notebook - тетрадь]  all the minutes she had spent in idleness that day.

On Sundays her mother made her tot them up and pray over them.  

At least, Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles would have called it idleness.

She went to her room to get a better thimble and she opened _Thistle Harvest_ guiltily  [guiltily - виновато] at random. [random - случайно]   

“The woods are so human,” wrote John Foster, “that to know them one must live with them.

An occasional  [occasional - случайно] saunter through them, keeping to the well-trodden paths, will never admit us to their intimacy.

If we wish to be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent, [frequent - часто]  reverent visits at all hours; by morning, by noon, [noon - полдень]  and by night; and at all seasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter.

Otherwise we can never really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary will never impose  [impose - навязывать] on them.

They have their own effective way of keeping aliens  [aliens - инопланетяне] at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere  [mere - просто] casual  [casual - случайно] sightseers.

It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive  [motive - мотив] except sheer  [sheer - откровенно] love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their sweet, old-world secrets from us.

But if they know we come to them because we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such treasures  [treasures - сокровища] of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any market-place.

For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly and hold nothing back from their true worshippers.

Then the immortal  [immortal - бессмертный] heart of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle  [subtle - тонкий] life will steal into our veins  [veins - вены] and make us its own forever, so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander  [wander - блуждать] we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring  [enduring - непреходящий] kinship.”  

“Doss,” called her mother from the hall below, “what are you doing all by yourself in that room?”  Valancy dropped _Thistle Harvest_ like a hot coal and fled  [fled - сбежал] downstairs to her patches; [patches - пятна]  but she felt the strange exhilaration  [exhilaration - волнение] of spirit that always came momentarily  [momentarily - на мгновение] to her when she dipped  [dipped - окунулся] into one of John Foster’s books.

Valancy did not know much about woods—except the haunted groves of oak and pine  [pine - сосна] around her Blue Castle.

But she had always secretly hankered after them and a Foster book about woods was the next best thing to the woods themselves.  

At noon  [noon - полдень] it stopped raining, but the sun did not come out until three.

Then Valancy timidly said she thought she would go uptown.  

“What do you want to go uptown for?” demanded her mother.  

“I want to get a book from the library.”  

“You got a book from the library only last week.”  

“No, it was four weeks.”  

“Four weeks.

Nonsense! [Nonsense - ерунда] ”  “Really it was, Mother.”  

“You are mistaken.

It cannot possibly have been more than two weeks.

I dislike contradiction. [contradiction - противоречие] 

And I do not see what you want to get a book for, anyhow.

You waste too much time reading.”  

“Of what value is my time?” asked Valancy bitterly. [bitterly - горько]   

“Doss!

Don’t speak in that tone to _me_.”  

“We need some tea,” said Cousin Stickles.

“She might go and get that if she wants a walk—though this damp weather is bad for colds.”  

They argued the matter for ten minutes longer and finally Mrs. Frederick agreed rather grudgingly that Valancy might go.     

CHAPTER IV   “Got your rubbers on?” called Cousin Stickles, as Valancy left the house.  

Christine Stickles had never once forgotten to ask that question when Valancy went out on a damp day.  

“Yes.”  “Have you got your flannel petticoat on?” asked Mrs. Frederick.  

“No.”  “Doss, I really do not understand you.

Do you want to catch your death of cold _again_?”

But Olive’s father had “married money” and Olive never had bronchitis.

So there you were.  

“Are you sure you didn’t leave the soap in the water?” demanded Mrs. Frederick.

But Valancy was gone.

She turned at the corner and looked back down the ugly, prim, respectable street where she lived.

The Stirling house was the ugliest on it—more like a red brick  [brick - кирпичный] box than anything else.

Too high for its breadth, and made still higher by a bulbous glass cupola on top.

About it was the desolate, [desolate - пустынный]  barren  [barren - бесплодный] peace of an old house whose life is lived.  

There was a very pretty little house, with leaded casements and dubbed  [dubbed - дублированный] gables, just around the corner—a new house, one of those houses you love the minute you see them.

Clayton Markley had built it for his bride.

He was to be married to Jennie Lloyd in June.

The little house, it was said, was furnished from attic  [attic - чердак] to cellar, [cellar - погреб]  in complete readiness for its mistress.  

“I don’t envy  [envy - зависть] Jennie the man,” thought Valancy sincerely—Clayton Markley was not one of her many ideals—“but I _

do_

envy  [envy - зависть] her the house.

It’s such a nice young house.

Oh, if I could only have a house of my own—ever so poor, so tiny—but my own!

But then,” she added bitterly, [bitterly - горько]  “there is no use in yowling for the moon when you can’t even get a tallow candle. [candle - свеча] ”  

In dreamland nothing would do Valancy but a castle of pale sapphire.

In real life she would have been fully satisfied with a little house of her own.

She envied  [envied - завидовал] Jennie Lloyd more fiercely  [fiercely - люто] than ever today.

Jennie was not so much better looking than she was, and not so very much younger.

Yet she was to have this delightful house.

And the nicest little Wedgwood teacups—Valancy had seen them; an open fireplace, [fireplace - камин]  and monogrammed linen; [linen - белье]  hemstitched tablecloths, [tablecloths - скатерти]  and china-closets.

Why did _everything_ come to some girls and _nothing_ to others?

It wasn’t fair.  

Motors were still rather a novelty  [novelty - новинка] in Deerwood, though they were common in Port Lawrence, and most of the summer residents  [residents - жители] up at Muskoka had them.

In Deerwood only some of the smart set had them; for even Deerwood was divided into sets.

There was the smart set—the intellectual  [intellectual - интеллектуальный] set—the old-family set—of which the Stirlings were members—the common run, and a few pariahs.

Not one of the Stirling clan  [clan - клан] had as yet condescended to a motor, though Olive was teasing  [teasing - дразнящий] her father to have one.

Valancy had never even been in a motorcar.

But she did not hanker after this.

In truth, she felt rather afraid of motorcars, especially at night.

They seemed to be too much like big purring beasts  [beasts - звери] that might turn and crush  [crush - давка] you—or make some terrible savage  [savage - дикарь] leap  [leap - прыжок] somewhere.

On the steep mountain trails around her Blue Castle only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly  [proudly - гордо] pace; [pace - шаг]  in real life Valancy would have been quite contented  [contented - довольный] to drive in a buggy  [buggy - багги] behind a nice horse.

She got a buggy  [buggy - багги] drive only when some uncle or cousin remembered to fling her “a chance,” like a bone to a dog.     

CHAPTER V   Of course she must buy the tea in Uncle Benjamin’s grocery- [grocery - продуктовый] store.

To buy it anywhere else was unthinkable.

Yet Valancy hated to go to Uncle Benjamin’s store on her twenty-ninth birthday.

There was no hope that he would not remember it.  

“Why,” demanded Uncle Benjamin, leeringly, as he tied up her tea, “are young ladies like bad grammarians?”  Valancy, with Uncle Benjamin’s will in the background of her mind, said meekly, “I don’t know.

On the first day Claude Bertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper  [whisper - шепот] to Joe, “Who is that?”

And Joe had said, “Valancy Stirling—one of the Deerwood old maids.”

“Curable or incurable? [incurable - неизлечимый] ”

Claude had asked with a snicker, evidently  [evidently - очевидно] thinking the question very clever.

Valancy smarted anew  [anew - снова] with the sting of that old recollection. [recollection - воспоминание]   

“Twenty-nine,” Uncle Benjamin was saying.

“Dear me, Doss, you’re dangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting married yet.

Twenty-nine.

It seems impossible.”  

Then Uncle Benjamin said an original thing.

Uncle Benjamin said, “How time does fly!”  

“_I_ think it _crawls_ [crawls - ползет] ,” said Valancy passionately. [passionately - страстно] 

Passion was so alien  [alien - чужое] to Uncle Benjamin’s conception  [conception - зачатие] of Valancy that he didn’t know what to make of her.

To cover his confusion, [confusion - путаница]  he asked another conundrum as he tied up her beans—Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last moment that they must have beans.

Beans were cheap and filling.  

“What two ages are apt  [apt - меткое] to prove illusory?” asked Uncle Benjamin; and, not waiting for Valancy to “give it up,” he added, “Mir-age and marriage.”  

“M-i-r-a-g-e  [e - е] is pronounced _mirazh_,” said Valancy shortly, [shortly - коротко]  picking up her tea and her beans.

For the moment she did not care whether Uncle Benjamin cut her out of his will or not.

She walked out of the store while Uncle Benjamin stared after her with his mouth open.

Then he shook his head.  

“Poor Doss is taking it hard,” he said.  

Valancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing.

Why had she lost her patience  [patience - терпение] like that?

Uncle Benjamin would be annoyed and would likely tell her mother that Doss had been impertinent—“to _me_!”—and her mother would lecture her for a week.  

“I’ve held my tongue for twenty years,” thought Valancy.

“Why couldn’t I have held it once more?”  

Yes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, since she had first been twitted with her loverless condition.

She remembered the bitter moment perfectly.

She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on the school playground while the other little girls of her class were playing a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner before you could play.

Nobody had chosen Valancy—little, pale, black-haired Valancy, with her prim, long-sleeved apron and odd, [odd - странное]  slanted eyes.  

“Oh,” said a pretty little girl to her, “I’m so sorry for you.

You haven’t got a beau.”  

Valancy had said defiantly, as she continued to say for twenty years, “I don’t _want_ a beau.”

But this afternoon Valancy once and for all stopped saying that.  

“I’m going to be honest with myself anyhow,” she thought savagely.

She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who passed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved  [disapproved - неодобрено] of them thoroughly. [thoroughly - тщательно] 

Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling—had been afraid of him ever since the Sunday, twenty-three years before, when he had first come to St. Albans’.

Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that day and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew.

No one else was in the church—nobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling.

Dr. Stalling stood up in front of the choir  [choir - хор] door, beckoned to her, and said sternly, “Little boy, come up here.”  

Valancy had stared around her.

There was no little boy—there was no one in all the huge church but herself.

This strange man with the blue glasses couldn’t mean her.

She was not a boy.  

“Little boy,” repeated Dr. Stalling, more sternly still, shaking his forefinger fiercely  [fiercely - жестоко] at her, “come up here at once!”  

Valancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle.

She was too terrified to do anything else.

What dreadful  [dreadful - ужасно] thing was going to happen to her?

What _had_ happened to her?

Had she actually turned into a boy?

She came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling.

Dr. Stalling shook his forefinger—such a long, knuckly forefinger—at her and said:  “Little boy, take off your hat.”  

Valancy took off her hat.

She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down her back, but Dr. Stalling was short-sighted and did not perceive  [perceive - воспринимать] it.  

“Little boy, go back to your seat and _always_ take off your hat in church.

_Remember_!”  

Valancy went back to her seat carrying her hat like an automaton.

Presently  [Presently - в настоящее время] her mother came in.  

“Doss,” said Mrs. Stirling, “what do you mean by taking off your hat?

Put it on instantly! [instantly - мгновенно] ”  

Valancy put it on instantly. [instantly - мгновенно] 

She was cold with fear lest Dr. Stalling should immediately summon  [summon - вызывать] her up front again.

She would have to go, of course—it never occurred to her that one could disobey the rector—and the church was full of people now.

Oh, what would she do if that horrible, stabbing  [stabbing - колоть] forefinger were shaken at her again before all those people?

Valancy sat through the whole service in an agony  [agony - агонию] of dread and was sick for a week afterwards.

Nobody knew why—Mrs. Frederick again bemoaned herself of her delicate  [delicate - деликатно] child.  

Dr. Stalling found out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy—who did not laugh.

She never got over her dread of Dr. Stalling.

And now to be caught by him on the street corner, thinking such things!  

Valancy got her John Foster book—_Magic of Wings_.

“His latest—all about birds,” said Miss Clarkson.

She had almost decided that she would go home, instead of going to see Dr. Trent.

Her courage had failed her.

She was afraid of offending  [offending - обидно] Uncle James—afraid of angering her mother—afraid of facing gruff, shaggy-browed old Dr. Trent, who would probably tell her, as he had told Cousin Gladys, that her trouble was entirely imaginary and that she only had it because she liked to have it.

No, she would not go; she would get a bottle of Redfern’s Purple Pills instead.

Valancy always felt very sceptical  [sceptical - скептический] concerning  [concerning - относительно] the virtues  [virtues - добродетелей] of the Purple Pills; but there _might_ be something in them; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. Trent alone.

She would glance over the magazines in the reading-room a few minutes and then go home.  

Valancy tried to read a story, but it made her furious. [furious - яростный] 

On every page was a picture of the heroine  [heroine - героиня] surrounded by adoring  [adoring - обожающий] men.

And here was she, Valancy Stirling, who could not get a solitary beau!

Valancy slammed  [slammed - хлопнул] the magazine shut; [shut - затворил]  she opened _Magic of Wings_.

Her eyes fell on the paragraph that changed her life.  

“_Fear is the original sin_ [sin - грех] ,” wrote John Foster.

“_Almost all the evil  [evil - злой] in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something_.

It is a cold, slimy serpent coiling about you.

It is horrible to live with fear; and it is of all things degrading. [degrading - унижающий] ”  

Valancy shut _Magic of Wings_ and stood up.

She would go and see Dr. Trent.     

CHAPTER VI   

The ordeal was not so dreadful, [dreadful - ужасный]  after all.

Dr. Trent was as gruff and abrupt as usual, but he did not tell her ailment was imaginary.

After he had listened to her symptoms and asked a few questions and made a quick examination, he sat for a moment looking at her quite intently.

Valancy thought he looked as if he were sorry for her.

She caught her breath for a moment.

Was the trouble serious?

Oh, it couldn’t be, surely—it really hadn’t bothered her _much_—only lately  [lately - в последнее время] it had got a little worse.  

Dr. Trent opened his mouth—but before he could speak the telephone at his elbow  [elbow - локоть] rang sharply. [sharply - резко] 

She heard him rushing madly  [madly - безумно] about overhead, barking  [barking - лай] out a few remarks  [remarks - замечания] to somebody—presumably  [presumably - предположительно] his housekeeper. [housekeeper - экономка] 

Then he came tearing downstairs with a club bag in his hand, snatched his hat and coat from the rack, [rack - стеллаж]  jerked open the street door and rushed down the street in the direction of the station.  

Valancy sat alone in the little office, feeling more absolutely foolish than she had ever felt before in her life.

Foolish—and humiliated. [humiliated - униженный] 

So this was all that had come of her heroic determination  [determination - решимость] to live up to John Foster and cast  [cast - отброшенный] fear aside. [aside - в сторону] 

Not only was she a failure as a relative and non-existent as a sweetheart or friend, but she was not even of any importance as a patient.

Dr. Trent had forgotten her very presence in his excitement over whatever message had come by the telephone.

She had gained nothing by ignoring Uncle James and flying in the face of family tradition.  

For a moment she was afraid she was going to cry.

It _was_ all so—ridiculous. [ridiculous - нелепый] 

Then she heard Dr. Trent’s housekeeper  [housekeeper - экономка] coming down the stairs.

Valancy rose and went to the office door.  

“The doctor forgot all about me,” she said with a twisted  [twisted - искривленный] smile.  

“Well, that’s too bad,” said Mrs. Patterson sympathetically.

“But it wasn’t much wonder, poor man.

That was a telegram they ’phoned over from the Port.

His son has been terribly  [terribly - ужасно] injured in an auto  [auto - авто] accident in Montreal.

The doctor had just ten minutes to catch the train.

Valancy went home by the short-cut of Lover’s Lane.

She did not often go through Lover’s Lane—but it was getting near supper-time and it would never do to be late.

Lover’s Lane wound back of the village, under great elms and maples, and deserved its name.

It was hard to go there at any time and not find some canoodling couple—or young girls in pairs, arms intertwined, earnestly talking over their little secrets.

Valancy didn’t know which made her feel more self-conscious and uncomfortable.  

This evening she encountered  [encountered - столкнулся] both.

She met Connie Hale and Kate Bayley, in new pink organdy dresses with flowers stuck coquettishly in their glossy, bare  [bare - голый] hair.

Valancy had never had a pink dress or worn flowers in her hair.

Then she passed a young couple she didn’t know, dandering along, oblivious  [oblivious - забывчивый] to everything but themselves.

The young man’s arm was around the girl’s waist  [waist - талия] quite shamelessly.

Valancy had never walked with a man’s arm about her.

She felt that she ought to be shocked— [shocked - шокированный] they might leave that sort of thing for the screening  [screening - экранирование] twilight, at least—but she wasn’t shocked.

In another flash  [flash - вспышка] of desperate, stark  [stark - абсолютная] honesty  [honesty - честность] she owned to herself that she was merely  [merely - просто] envious. [envious - завидующий] 

When she passed them she felt quite sure they were laughing at her—pitying her—“there’s that queer  [queer - педик] little old maid, Valancy Stirling.

They say she never had a beau in her whole life”—Valancy fairly ran to get out of Lover’s Lane.

Never had she felt so utterly  [utterly - совершенно] colourless  [colourless - бесцветный] and skinny and insignificant.  

Just where Lover’s Lane debouched on the street, an old car was parked.

Valancy knew that car well—by sound, at least—and everybody in Deerwood knew it.

This was before the phrase “tin Lizzie” had come into circulation— [circulation - тираж] in Deerwood, at least; but if it had been known, this car was the tinniest of Lizzies—though it was not a Ford but an old Grey Slosson.

Valancy gave him a swift, [swift - стремительный]  furtive look as she hurried by.

This was only the second time she had ever seen the notorious  [notorious - пресловутый] Barney Snaith, though she had heard enough about him in the five years that he had been living “up back” in Muskoka.

The first time had been nearly a year ago, on the Muskoka road.

He had been crawling  [crawling - ползающий] out from under his car then, too, and he had given her a cheerful grin  [grin - ухмылка]  [grin - ухмылка] as she went by—a little, whimsical grin that gave him the look of an amused gnome.

He didn’t look bad—she didn’t believe he was bad, in spite  [spite - злоба] of the wild yarns that were always being told of him.

Of course he went tearing in that terrible old Grey Slosson through Deerwood at hours when all decent  [decent - порядочный] people were in bed—often with old “Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel,” who made the night hideous with his howls—“both of them dead drunk, my dear. [dear - дорогой] ”

And every one knew that he was an escaped convict  [convict - зек] and a defaulting bank clerk  [clerk - клерк] and a murderer in hiding and an infidel and an illegitimate son of old Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel Gay and the father of Roaring Abel’s illegitimate grandchild and a counterfeiter and a forger  [forger - фальсификатор] and a few other awful things.

But still Valancy didn’t believe he was bad.

Nobody with a smile like that could be bad, no matter what he had done.  

But he still retained something a little grim  [grim - мрачный] about the jaw. [jaw - челюсть]   

Barney Snaith looked even more disreputable than usual just now.

It was very evident  [evident - очевидный] that he hadn’t shaved for days, and his hands and arms, bare  [bare - голый] to the shoulders, were black with grease.

But he was whistling  [whistling - свистящий] gleefully to himself and he seemed so happy that Valancy envied  [envied - завидный] him.

She envied  [envied - завидный] him his light-heartedness and his irresponsibility and his mysterious little cabin  [cabin - кабина] up on an island in Lake Mistawis—even his rackety old Grey Slosson.

Neither he nor his car had to be respectable and live up to traditions.

When he rattled past her a few minutes later, bareheaded, leaning  [leaning - прислоненный] back in his Lizzie at a raffish angle, his longish hair blowing in the wind, a villainous-looking old black pipe in his mouth, she envied  [envied - завидный] him again.

Men had the best of it, no doubt about that.

This outlaw happy, whatever he was or wasn’t.

She, Valancy Stirling, respectable, well-behaved to the last degree, was unhappy and had always been unhappy.

So there you were.  

Valancy was just in time for supper.

The sun had clouded over, and a dismal, [dismal - мрачный]  drizzling rain was falling again.

Cousin Stickles had the neuralgia.

Valancy had to do the family darning and there was no time for _Magic of Wings_.  

“Can’t the darning wait till tomorrow?”

she pleaded. [pleaded - умоляющий]   

“Tomorrow will bring its own duties,” said Mrs. Frederick inexorably.  

Valancy darned all the evening and listened to Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles talking the eternal, [eternal - вечный]  niggling gossip of the clan, [clan - клан]  as they knitted drearily at interminable  [interminable - бесконечный] black stockings.

On the whole, they approved.

Second Cousin Lilian was doing well for herself.  

“Though she hasn’t hurried,” said Cousin Stickles.

“She must be twenty-five.”  

“There have not—fortunately—been many old maids in our connection,” said Mrs. Frederick bitterly. [bitterly - горько]   

Valancy flinched.

She had run the darning needle into her finger.  

Third Cousin Aaron Gray had been scratched  [scratched - царапал] by a cat and had blood-poisoning  [poisoning - отравление] in his finger.

“Cats are most dangerous animals,” said Mrs. Frederick.

“I would never have a cat about the house.”  

She glared significantly  [significantly - значительно] at Valancy through her terrible glasses.

Once, five years ago, Valancy had asked if she might have a cat.

She had never referred to it since, but Mrs. Frederick still suspected  [suspected - подозревал] her of harbouring the unlawful  [unlawful - неправомерное] desire in her heart of hearts.  

Once Valancy sneezed. [sneezed - чихнул] 

Now, in the Stirling code, it was very bad form to sneeze  [sneeze - чихнуть] in public.  

“You can always repress  [repress - подавить] a sneeze by pressing your finger on your upper lip,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.  

Half-past nine o’clock and so, as Mr. Pepys would say, to bed.

But First Cousin Stickles’ neuralgic back must be rubbed  [rubbed - натер] with Redfern’s Liniment.

Valancy did that.

Valancy always had to do it.

She hated the smell of Redfern’s Liniment—she hated the smug, [smug - самодовольно]  beaming, portly, be-whiskered, be-spectacled picture of Dr. Redfern on the bottle.

Her fingers smelled of the horrible stuff after she got into bed, in spite  [spite - назло] of all the scrubbing she gave them.  

Valancy’s day of destiny  [destiny - судьба] had come and gone.

She ended it as she had begun it, in tears.     

CHAPTER VII   

There was a rosebush on the little Stirling lawn, [lawn - лужайка]  growing beside the gate.

It was called “Doss’s rosebush.”

Cousin Georgiana had given it to Valancy five years ago and Valancy had planted it joyfully. [joyfully - радостно] 

That was her luck.

Valancy did everything she could think of and took the advice of everybody in the clan, [clan - клан]  but still the rosebush would not bloom. [bloom - цветение] 

It throve and grew luxuriantly, with great leafy branches untouched  [untouched - нетронутый] of rust or spider; but not even a bud  [bud - бутон] had ever appeared on it.

Valancy, looking at it two days after her birthday, was filled with a sudden, overwhelming  [overwhelming - подавляющий] hatred  [hatred - ненависть] for it.

The thing wouldn’t bloom: [bloom - цветение]  very well, then, she would cut it down.

She marched to the tool-room in the barn  [barn - амбар] for her garden knife and she went at the rosebush viciously. [viciously - злобно] 

A few minutes later horrified Mrs. Frederick came out to the verandah  [verandah - веранда] and beheld her daughter slashing  [slashing - рубящий] insanely among the rosebush boughs.

Half of them were already strewn on the walk.

The bush looked sadly dismantled.  

“Doss, what on earth are you doing?

Have you gone crazy?”  

“No,” said Valancy.

She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too strong for her.

She said it deprecatingly.

“I—I just made up my mind to cut this bush down.

It is no good.

It never blooms [bloom - цветение] — [blooms - цветы] never will bloom.”  

“That is no reason for destroying it,” said Mrs. Frederick sternly.

“It was a beautiful bush and quite ornamental. [ornamental - декоративный] 

You have made a sorry-looking thing of it.”  

“Rose trees should _bloom_ [bloom - цветок] ,” said Valancy a little obstinately.  

“Don’t argue with _me_, Doss.

Clear up that mess and leave the bush alone.

“The bush is mine,” muttered  [muttered - пробормотал] Valancy.  

“What’s that?

What did you say, Doss?”  

“I only said the bush was mine,” repeated Valancy humbly.  

Mrs. Frederick turned without a word and marched back into the house.

The mischief was done now.

Valancy knew she had offended  [offended - обиженный] her mother deeply and would not be spoken to or noticed in any way for two or three days.

Cousin Stickles would see to Valancy’s bringing-up but Mrs. Frederick would preserve the stony silence of outraged majesty.  

Valancy sighed  [sighed - вздохнул] and put away her garden knife, hanging it precisel [precise - точный] y  [precisely - точно] on its precise nail in the tool-shop.

She cleared away  [away - прочь] the severed branches and swept  [swept - метал] up the leaves.

Her lips twitched  [twitched - дернул] as she looked at the straggling bush.

It had an odd  [odd - странно] resemblance to its shaken, scrawny donor, [donor - донор]  little Cousin Georgiana herself.  

“I certainly have made an awful-looking thing of it,” thought Valancy.  

But she did not feel repentant—only sorry she had offended  [offended - обиделся] her mother.

Things would be so uncomfortable until she was forgiven.

Mrs. Frederick was one of those women who can make their anger felt all over a house.

Walls and doors are no protection from it.  

“You’d better go uptown and git the mail,” said Cousin Stickles, when Valancy went in.

“_I_ can’t go—I feel all sorter peaky and piny this spring.

I want you to stop at the drugstore and git me a bottle of Redfern’s Blood Bitters.

There’s nothing like Redfern’s Bitters for building a body up.

Cousin James says the Purple Pills are the best, but I know better.

My poor dear husband took Redfern’s Bitters right up to the day he died.

Don’t let them charge you more’n ninety cents.

I kin git it for that at the Port.

And what _have_

you been saying to your poor mother?

Do you ever stop to think, Doss, that you kin only have one mother?”  

“One is enough for me,” thought Valancy undutifully, as she went uptown.  

She got Cousin Stickles’ bottle of bitters and then she went to the post-office and asked for her mail at the General Delivery.

Her mother did not have a box.

They got too little mail to bother with it.

Valancy did not expect any mail, except the _Christian Times_, which was the only paper they took.

They hardly ever got any letters.

But Valancy rather liked to stand in the office and watch Mr. Carewe, the grey-bearded, [bearded - бородатый]  Santa-Clausy old clerk, [clerk - клерк]  handing out letters to the lucky people who did get them.

He did it with such a detached, impersonal, [impersonal - безличный]  Jove-like air, as if it did not matter in the least to him what supernal joys or shattering  [shattering - сокрушительный] horrors might be in those letters for the people to whom they were addressed.

In her Blue Castle exciting epistles, bound  [bound - связанный] with silk and sealed with crimson, were always being brought to her by pages in livery of gold and blue, but in real life her only letters were occasional  [occasional - случайный] perfunctory notes from relatives or an advertising circular.  

Consequently  [Consequently - Поэтому] she was immensely  [immensely - безмерно] surprised when Mr. Carewe, looking even more Jovian than usual, poked a letter out to her.

Yes, it was addressed to her plainly, [plainly - явно]  in a fierce, [fierce - жестокий]  black hand: “Miss Valancy Stirling, Elm Street, Deerwood”—and the postmark was Montreal.

Valancy picked it up with a little quickening of her breath.

Montreal!

It must be from Doctor Trent.

He had remembered her, after all.  

Valancy met Uncle Benjamin coming in as she was going out and was glad the letter was safely in her bag.  

“What,” said Uncle Benjamin, “is the difference between a donkey  [donkey - осел] and a postage-stamp?”  

“I don’t know.

What?” answered Valancy dutifully. [dutifully - послушно]   

“One you lick  [lick - лизать] with a stick  [stick - палку] and the other you stick with a lick.

Ha, ha!”  

Uncle Benjamin passed in, tremendously  [tremendously - чрезвычайно] pleased with himself.  

Cousin Stickles pounced  [pounced - набросился] on the _Times_ when Valancy got home, but it did not occur to her to ask if there were any letters.

Mrs. Frederick would have asked it, but Mrs. Frederick’s lips at present were sealed.

Valancy was glad of this.

If her mother had asked if there were any letters Valancy would have had to admit there was.

Then she would have had to let her mother and Cousin Stickles read the letter and all would be discovered.  

Her heart acted strangely on the way upstairs, and she sat down by her window for a few minutes before opening her letter.

She felt very guilty and deceitful.

She had never before kept a letter secret from her mother.

Every letter she had ever written or received had been read by Mrs. Frederick.

That had never mattered.

Valancy had never had anything to hide.

But this _did_

matter.

She could not have any one see this letter.

But her fingers trembled with a consciousness  [consciousness - сознание] of wickedness and unfilial conduct as she opened it—trembled a little, too, perhaps, with apprehension. [apprehension - предчувствие] 

She felt quite sure there was nothing seriously wrong with her heart but—one never knew.  

Dr. Trent’s letter was like himself—blunt, abrupt, concise, wasting no words.

Dr. Trent never beat about the bush.

“Dear Miss Sterling”—and then a page of black, positive writing.

Valancy seemed to read it at a glance; she dropped it on her lap, [lap - на коленях]  her face ghost-white.  

He said, without mincing matters, that nothing could be done for her.

If she took great care of herself she might live a year—but she might also die at any moment—Dr. Trent never troubled himself about euphemisms.

She must be careful to avoid all excitement and all severe muscular  [muscular - мускулистый] efforts.

She must eat and drink moderately, she must never run, she must go upstairs and uphill with great care.

Any sudden jolt or shock might be fatal. [fatal - смертельный] 

She was to get the prescription  [prescription - рецепт] he enclosed filled and carry it with her always, taking a dose  [dose - доза] whenever her attacks came on.

And he was hers truly, H. B. Trent.  

Valancy sat for a long while by her window.

Outside was a world drowned  [drowned - утонул] in the light of a spring afternoon—skies entrancingly blue, winds perfumed and free, lovely, soft, blue hazes at the end of every street.

Over at the railway station a group of young girls was waiting for a train; she heard their gay laughter as they chattered and joked.

The train roared  [roared - заревел]  [roared - заревел] in and roared out again.

But none of these things had any reality.

Nothing had any reality except the fact that she had only another year to live.  

When she was tired of sitting at the window she went over and lay down on her bed, staring at the cracked, [cracked - треснул]  discoloured ceiling. [ceiling - потолок] 

The curious  [curious - любопытный] numbness that follows on a staggering  [staggering - ошеломляющий] blow  [blow - удар] possessed her.

She did not feel anything except a boundless surprise and incredulity—behind which was the conviction  [conviction - осуждение] that Dr. Trent knew his business and that she, Valancy Stirling, who had never lived, was about to die.  

When the gong  [gong - гонг] rang for supper Valancy got up and went downstairs mechanically, [mechanically - механически]  from force of habit.

She wondered that she had been let alone so long.

But of course her mother would not pay any attention to her just now.

Valancy was thankful for this.

Valancy forced  [forced - вынужденный] herself to swallow  [swallow - глотать] a cup of tea and then sat and watched the others eat, with an odd  [odd - странный] feeling that years had passed since she had sat with them at the dinner-table.

She found herself smiling inwardly to think what a commotion  [commotion - переполох] she could make if she chose.

Let her merely  [merely - просто] tell them what was in Dr. Trent’s letter and there would be as much fuss made as if—Valancy thought bitterly— [bitterly - горько] they really cared two straws about her.  

“Dr. Trent’s housekeeper  [housekeeper - домработница] got word from him today,” said Cousin Stickles, so suddenly that Valancy jumped guiltily. [guiltily - виновно] 

Was there anything in thought waves?

“Mrs. Judd was talking to her uptown.

They think his son will recover, but Dr. Trent wrote that if he did he was going to take him abroad as soon as he was able to travel and wouldn’t be back here for a year at least.”  

“That will not matter much to _us_,” said Mrs. Frederick majestically.

“He is not _our_ doctor.

I would not”—here

she looked or seemed to look accusingly right through Valancy—“have _him_ to doctor  [doctor - доктор] a sick cat.”  

“May I go upstairs and lie down?” said Valancy faintly. [faintly - слабо] 

“I—I have a headache.”  

“What has given you a headache?” asked Cousin Stickles, since Mrs. Frederick would not.

The question had to be asked.

Valancy could not be allowed to have headaches without interference. [interference - вмешательство]   

“You ain’t in the habit of having headaches.

I hope you’re not taking the mumps.

Here, try a spoonful of vinegar. [vinegar - уксус] ”  

“Piffle!” said Valancy rudely, getting up from the table.

She did not care just then if she were rude.

She had had to be so polite all her life.  

If it had been possible for Cousin Stickles to turn pale she would have.

As it was not, she turned yellower.  

“Are you sure you ain’t feverish, [feverish - лихорадочный]  Doss?

You sound like it.

she said.  

Cousin Stickles stared and gasped.

“What—what do you mean?”  “I said I wouldn’t be rubbed  [rubbed - натер] with Redfern’s Liniment,” repeated Valancy.

“Horrid, [Horrid - Ужасный]  sticky stuff!

And it has the vilest smell of any liniment I ever saw.

It’s no good.

I want to be left alone, that’s all.”  

Valancy went out, leaving Cousin Stickles aghast.  

“She’s feverish— [feverish - лихорадочный]  [feverish - лихорадочный] she _must_ be feverish,” ejaculated Cousin Stickles.  

Mrs. Frederick went on eating her supper.

It did not matter whether Valancy was or was not feverish. [feverish - лихорадочный] 

Valancy had been guilty of impertinence to _her_.     

CHAPTER VIII   Valancy did not sleep that night.

She lay awake all through the long dark hours—thinking—thinking.

She made a discovery that surprised her: she, who had been afraid of almost everything in life, was not afraid of death.

It did not seem in the least terrible to her.

And she need not now be afraid of anything else.

Why had she been afraid of things?

Because of life.

Afraid of Uncle Benjamin because of the menace of poverty in old age.

But now she would never be old—neglected—tolerated. [tolerated - терпит] 

Afraid of being an old maid all her life.

But now she would not be an old maid very long.

Afraid of offending  [offending - оскорбляющий] her mother and her clan  [clan - клан] because she had to live with and among them and couldn’t live peaceably if she didn’t give in to them.

But now she hadn’t.

Valancy felt a curious  [curious - любопытный] freedom.  

But she was still horribly afraid of one thing—the fuss the whole jamfry of them would make when she told them.

Valancy shuddered at the thought of it.

She couldn’t endure  [endure - терпит] it.

Oh, she knew so well how it would be.

First there would be indignation—yes, indignation on the part of Uncle James because she had gone to a doctor—any doctor—without consulting  [consulting - консультирует] HIM.

Indignation on the part of her mother for being so sly and deceitful—“to your own mother, Doss.”

Indignation on the part of the whole clan  [clan - клан] because she had not gone to Dr. Marsh.  

Then would come the solicitude.

She would be taken to Dr. Marsh, and when Dr. Marsh confirmed Dr. Trent’s diagnosis  [diagnosis - диагноз] she would be taken to specialists in Toronto and Montreal.

the doctors had given up”—and her mother would insist on Redfern’s Blood Bitters, and Cousin Stickles would insist on rubbing  [rubbing - тереть] her over the heart every night with Redfern’s Liniment on the grounds that it _might_ do good  [good - добро] and _couldn’t_ do harm; [harm - вред]  and everybody else would have some pet dope for her to take.

Dr. Stalling would come to her and say solemnly, “You are very ill.

Are you prepared for what may be before you?”—almost as if he were going to shake his forefinger at her, the forefinger that had not grown any shorter or less knobbly with age.

And she would be watched and checked like a baby and never let do anything or go anywhere alone.

Perhaps she would not even be allowed to sleep alone lest she die in her sleep.

Cousin Stickles or her mother would insist on sharing her room and bed.

Yes, undoubtedly  [undoubtedly - несомненно] they would.  

It was this last thought that really decided Valancy.

She could not put up with it and she wouldn’t.

As the clock in the hall below struck twelve Valancy suddenly and definitely made up her mind that she would not tell anybody.

She had always been told, ever since she could remember, that she must hide her feelings.

“It is not ladylike  [ladylike - дамский] to have feelings,” Cousin Stickles had once told her disapprovingly.

Well, she would hide them with a vengeance.  

But though she was not afraid of death she was not indifferent  [indifferent - безразличный] to it.

She found that she _resented_ [resented - обиженный]  it; it was not fair that she should have to die when she had never lived.

Rebellion  [Rebellion - Восстание] flamed up in her soul as the dark hours passed by—not because she had no future but because she had no past.  

“I’m poor—I’m ugly—I’m a failure—and I’m near death,” she thought.

She could see her own obituary  [obituary - некролог] notice in the Deerwood _Weekly Times_, copied into the Port Lawrence _Journal_.

“A deep  [deep - глубокий] gloom  [gloom - мрак] was cast  [cast - бросок] over Deerwood, etc., etc.”—“leaves

a large circle of friends to mourn, etc., etc., etc.”—lies, all lies.

Gloom, forsooth!

Nobody would miss her.

Her death would not matter a straw to anybody.

Not even her mother loved her—her mother who had been so disappointed that she was not a boy—or at least, a pretty girl.  

Valancy reviewed  [reviewed - пересмотренный] her whole life between midnight and the early spring dawn. [dawn - рассвет] 

These incidents were all unpleasant in one way or another.

Nothing really pleasant had ever happened to Valancy.  

“I’ve never had one wholly  [wholly - целиком] happy hour in my life—not one,” she thought.

“I’ve just been a colourless  [colourless - бесцветный] nonentity.

I remember reading somewhere once that there is an hour in which a woman might be happy all her life if she could but find it.

I’ve never found my hour—never, never.

And I never will now.

If I could only have had that hour I’d be willing  [willing - готовый] to die.”  

Those significant incidents kept bobbing up in her mind like unbidden ghosts, without any sequence of time or place.

For instance, that time when, at sixteen, she had blued a tubful of clothes too deeply.

And the time when, at eight, she had “stolen” some raspberry jam from Aunt Wellington’s pantry.

Valancy never heard the last of those two misdemeanours.

At almost every clan  [clan - клан] gathering they were raked up against her as jokes.

Uncle Benjamin hardly ever missed re-telling the raspberry jam incident—he had been the one to catch her, her face all stained  [stained - запятнанный] and streaked.  

“I have really done so few bad things that they have to keep harping on the old ones,” thought Valancy.

“Why, I’ve never even had a quarrel  [quarrel - ссора] with any one.

I haven’t an enemy.

What a spineless thing I must be not to have even one enemy!”  

There was that incident of the dust-pile at school when she was seven.

Valancy always recalled it when Dr. Stalling referred to the text, “To him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath.”

Other people might puzzle  [puzzle - загадка] over that text but it never puzzled  [puzzled - озадаченный] Valancy.

The whole relationship between herself and Olive, dating from the day of the dust-pile, was a commentary  [commentary - комментарий] on it.  

She had been going to school a year, but Olive, who was a year younger, had just begun and had about her all the glamour  [glamour - гламур] of “a new girl” and an exceedingly pretty girl at that.

It was at recess  [recess - перерыв] and all the girls, big and little, were out on the road in front of the school making dust-piles.

The aim of each girl was to have the biggest pile.

Valancy was good at making dust-piles—there was an art in it—and she had secret hopes of leading.

But Olive, working off by herself, was suddenly discovered to have a larger dust-pile than anybody.

Valancy felt no jealousy.

Her dust-pile was quite big enough to please her.

Then one of the older girls had an inspiration. [inspiration - вдохновение]   

“Let’s put all our dust on Olive’s pile and make a tremendous  [tremendous - огромный] one,” she exclaimed. [exclaimed - воскликнул]   

Valancy turned away  [away - прочь] resolutely  [resolutely - решительно] and began building another dust-pile.

Again a bigger girl pounced  [pounced - набросился] on it.

Valancy stood before it, flushed, indignant, arms outspread.  

“Don’t take it,” she pleaded. [pleaded - умолял] 

“Please don’t take it.”  

“But _why_?” demanded the older girl.

“Why won’t you help to build Olive’s bigger?”  

“I want my own little dust-pile,” said Valancy piteously.  

Her plea  [plea - умолял] went unheeded.

While she argued with one girl another scraped up her dust-pile.

Valancy turned away, her heart swelling, her eyes full of tears.  

“Jealous—you’re jealous!” said the girls mockingly.  

“You were very selfish,” said her mother coldly, when Valancy told her about it at night.

That was the first and last time Valancy had ever taken any of her troubles to her mother.  

Valancy was neither jealous nor selfish.

It was only that she wanted a dust-pile of her own—small or big mattered not.

A team of horses came down the street—Olive’s dust pile was scattered over the roadway—the bell rang—the girls trooped into school and had forgotten the whole affair before they reached their seats.

Valancy never forgot it.

To this day she resented  [resented - возмущался] it in her secret soul.

But was it not symbolical of her life?  

“I’ve never been able to have my own dust-pile,” thought Valancy.  

The enormous red moon she had seen rising right at the end of the street one autumn evening of her sixth year.

She had been sick and cold with the awful, uncanny horror of it.

So near to her.

So big.

She had run in trembling to her mother and her mother had laughed at her.

She had gone to bed and hidden her face under the clothes in terror  [terror - ужас] lest she might look at the window and see that horrible moon glaring in at her through it.  

The boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen.

She had not let him—she had evaded him and run.

He was the only boy who had ever tried to kiss her.

Now, fourteen years later, Valancy found herself wishing that she had let him.  

The time she had been made to apologise to Olive for something she hadn’t done.

Olive had said that Valancy had pushed her into the mud and spoiled  [spoiled - испорченный] her new shoes _on purpose_.

Valancy knew she hadn’t.

It had been an accident—and even that wasn’t her fault—but nobody would believe her.

She had to apologise—and kiss Olive to “make up.”

The injustice  [injustice - несправедливость] of it burned in her soul tonight.  

That summer when Olive had the most beautiful hat, trimmed with creamy  [creamy - сливочный] yellow net, with a wreath of red roses  [roses - розы] and little ribbon bows under the chin.

Valancy had wanted a hat like that more than she had ever wanted anything.

She pleaded  [pleaded - умолял] for one and had been laughed at—all summer she had to wear a horrid  [horrid - ужасный] little brown sailor with elastic  [elastic - эластичный] that cut behind her ears.

None of the girls would go around with her because she was so shabby— [shabby - потрепанный] nobody but Olive.

“Even then she knew that.”  

Valancy had tried to win a prize for attendance  [attendance - посещаемость] in Sunday School once.

But Olive won it.

There were so many Sundays Valancy had to stay home because she had colds.

She had once tried to “say a piece” in school one Friday afternoon and had broken down in it.

Olive was a good reciter and never got stuck.  

The night she had spent in Port Lawrence with Aunt Isabel when she was ten.

Byron Stirling was there; from Montreal, twelve years old, conceited, clever.

At family prayers in the morning Byron had reached across and given Valancy’s thin arm such a savage  [savage - дикарь] pinch that she screamed out with pain.

After prayers were over she was summoned to Aunt Isabel’s bar of judgment. [judgment - суд] 

But when she said Byron had pinched her Byron denied it.

He said she cried out because the kitten scratched  [scratched - оцарапал] her.

He said she had put the kitten up on her chair and was playing with it when she should have been listening to Uncle David’s prayer.

He was _believed_.

In the Stirling clan  [clan - клан] the boys were always believed before the girls.

Valancy was sent home in disgrace  [disgrace - позор] because of her exceedingly bad behavior during family prayers and she was not asked to Aunt Isabel’s again for many moons.  

The time Cousin Betty Stirling was married.

Somehow Valancy got wind of the fact that Betty was going to ask her to be one of her bridesmaids.

Valancy was secretly uplifted.

It would be a delightful thing to be a bridesmaid.

And of course she would have to have a new dress for it—a pretty new dress—a pink dress.

Betty wanted her bridesmaids to dress in pink.  

But Betty had never asked her, after all.

Valancy couldn’t guess why, but long after her secret tears of disappointment  [disappointment - разочарование] had been dried Olive told her.

Betty, after much consultation  [consultation - консультация] and reflection, [reflection - размышление]  had decided that Valancy was too insignificant—she would “spoil  [spoil - портить] the effect.”

That was nine years ago.

But tonight Valancy caught her breath with the old pain and sting of it.  

That day in her eleventh year when her mother had badgered her into confessing  [confessing - признание] something she had never done.

Valancy had denied it for a long time but eventually for peace’ sake  [sake - ради] she had given in and pleaded  [pleaded - умолял] guilty.

Mrs. Frederick was always making people lie by pushing them into situations where they _had_ to lie.

Then her mot [O - O] her had made her kneel  [kneel - преклонить колени] down on the parlour floor, between herself and Cousin Stickles, and say, “O God, please forgive me for not speaking the truth.”

Valancy had not then heard of Galileo but her fate  [fate - судьба] was similar to his.

She was punished just as severely  [severely - сурово] as if she hadn’t confessed  [confessed - признался] and prayed.  

The winter she went to dancing-school.

Uncle James had decreed she should go and had paid for her lessons.

How she had looked forward to it!

And how she had hated it!

She had never had a voluntary  [voluntary - добровольный] partner.

The teacher always had to tell some boy to dance with her, and generally he had been sulky about it.

Yet Valancy was a good dancer, as light on her feet as thistledown.

Olive, who never lacked  [lacked - отсутствовал] eager  [eager - нетерпеливый] partners, was heavy.  

The affair of the button-string, when she was ten.

All the girls in school had button-strings.

Olive had a very long one with a great many beautiful buttons.

Valancy had one.

Most of the buttons on it were very commonplace, [commonplace - обыденный]  but she had six beauties that had come off Grandmother Stirling’s wedding-gown—sparkling  [sparkling - искрящийся] buttons of gold and glass, much more beautiful than any Olive had.

Their possession conferred  [conferred - удостоил] a certain distinction  [distinction - отличия] on Valancy.

She knew every little girl in school envied  [envied - завидовал] her the exclusive  [exclusive - эксклюзивный] possession of those beautiful buttons.

When Olive saw them on the button-string she had looked at them narrowly  [narrowly - узко] but said nothing—then.

The next day Aunt Wellington had come to Elm Street and told Mrs. Frederick that she thought Olive should have some of those buttons—Grandmother Stirling was just as much Wellington’s mother as Frederick’s.

Mrs. Frederick had agreed amiably.

She could not afford to fall out with Aunt Wellington.

Moreover, the matter was of no importance whatever.

Aunt Wellington carried off four of the buttons, generously  [generously - щедро] leaving two for Valancy.

Valancy had torn these from her string and flung them on the floor—she had not yet learned that it was unladylike to have feelings—and had been sent supperless to bed for the exhibition.  

The night of Margaret Blunt’s party.

She had made such pathetic efforts to be pretty that night.

At Margaret’s party Rob never even asked her to dance—did not notice her at all.

She was a wallflower, as usual.

That, of course, was years ago.

People in Deerwood had long since given up inviting Valancy to dances.

But to Valancy its humiliation  [humiliation - унижение] and disappointment  [disappointment - разочарование] were of the other day.

Her face burned in the darkness  [darkness - мрак] as she recalled herself, sitting there with her pitifully crimped, thin hair and the cheeks  [cheeks - щеки] she had pinched for an hour before coming, in an effort to make them red.

All that came of it was a wild story that Valancy Stirling was rouged at Margaret Blunt’s party.

In those days in Deerwood that was enough to wreck  [wreck - крушение] your character forever.

It did not wreck  [wreck - крушение] Valancy’s, or even damage it.

People knew _she_ couldn’t be fast if she tried.

They only laughed at her.  

“I’ve had nothing but a second-hand existence,” decided Valancy.

“All the great emotions of life have passed me by.

I’ve never even had a grief. [grief - горе] 

And have I ever really loved anybody?

Do I really love Mother?

No, I don’t.

That’s the truth, whether it is disgraceful or not.

I don’t love her—I’ve never loved her.

What’s worse, I don’t even like her.

So I don’t know anything about any kind of love.

My life has been empty—empty.

Nothing is worse than emptiness. [emptiness - пустота] 

Nothing!”

Valancy ejaculated the last “nothing” aloud passionately. [passionately - страстно] 

Then she moaned and stopped thinking about anything for a while.

One of her attacks of pain had come on.  

When it was over something had happened to Valancy—perhaps the culmination  [culmination - кульминация] of the process that had been going on in her mind ever since she had read Dr. Trent’s letter.

It was three o’clock in the morning—the wisest and most accursed hour of the clock.

But sometimes it sets us free.  

“I’ve been trying to please other people all my life and failed,” she said.

“After this I shall please myself.

I shall never pretend anything again.

I’ve breathed an atmosphere of fibs and pretences and evasions all my life.

What a luxury it will be to tell the truth!

I may not be able to do much that I want to do

but I won’t do another thing that I don’t want to do.

Mother can pout for weeks—I shan’t worry over it.

‘Despair is a free man—hope is a slave.’”  

Valancy got up and dressed, with a deepening of that curious  [curious - любопытный] sense of freedom.

When she had finished with her hair she opened the window and hurled the jar of potpourri over into the next lot.

It smashed  [smashed - разбитый] gloriously against the schoolgirl complexion  [complexion - цвет лица] on the old carriage- [carriage - карета] shop.  

“I’m sick of the fragrance  [fragrance - аромат] of dead things,” said Valancy.     

Uncle Benjamin was considered to have gone entirely too far when he had ejaculated, “She’s dippy—I tell you, she’s dippy,” and was only excused because of the outrageousness of Valancy’s conduct at the aforesaid wedding dinner.  

But Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles had noticed a few things that made them uneasy _before_ the dinner.

It had begun with the rosebush, of course; and Valancy never was really “quite right” again.

She did not seem to worry in the least over the fact that her mother was not speaking to her.

You would never suppose she noticed it at all.

She had flatly refused to take either Purple Pills or Redfern’s Bitters.

She had announced coolly that she did not intend to answer to the name of “Doss” any longer.

She had told Cousin Stickles that she wished she would give up wearing that brooch with Cousin Artemas Stickles’ hair in it.

She had moved her bed in her room to the opposite corner.

She had read _Magic of Wings_ Sunday afternoon.

When Cousin Stickles had rebuked her Valancy had said indifferently, “Oh, I forgot it was Sunday”—and _had gone on reading it_.  

Cousin Stickles had seen a terrible thing—she had caught Valancy sliding  [sliding - скользит] down the bannister.

Cousin Stickles did not tell Mrs. Frederick this—poor Amelia was worried enough as it was.

But it was Valancy’s announcement on Saturday night that she was not going to go to the Anglican church any more that broke through Mrs. Frederick’s stony silence.  

“Not going to church any more!

Doss, have you absolutely taken leave——”  “Oh, I’m going to church,” said Valancy airily.

“I’m going to the Presbyterian church.

But to the Anglican church I will not go.”  

This was even worse.

Mrs. Frederick had recourse to tears, having found outraged majesty had ceased  [ceased - прекратил] to be effective.  

“What have you got against the Anglican church?”

she sobbed. [sobbed - рыдал]   

“Nothing—only just that you’ve always made me go there.

If you’d made me go to the Presbyterian church I’d want to go to the Anglican.”  

“Is that a nice thing to say to your mother?

Oh, how true it is that it is sharper than a serpent’s tooth to have a thankless child.”  

“Is that a nice thing to say to your daughter?” said unrepentant Valancy.  

So Valancy’s behaviour at the silver wedding was not quite the surprise to Mrs. Frederick and Christine Stickles that it was to the rest.

They were doubtful  [doubtful - сомнительный] about the wisdom  [wisdom - мудрость] of taking her, but concluded it would “make talk” if they didn’t.

Perhaps she would behave herself, and so far no outsider  [outsider - посторонний] suspected  [suspected - подозревался] there was anything queer  [queer - странный] about her.

By a special mercy  [mercy - милосердие] of Providence it had poured torrents Sunday morning, so Valancy had not carried out her hideous threat of going to the Presbyterian church.  

Valancy would not have cared in the least if they had left her at home.

These family celebrations were all hopelessly  [hopelessly - безнадежно] dull. [dull - тупой] 

But the Stirlings always celebrated everything.

It was a long-established custom.

Even Mrs. Frederick gave a dinner party on her wedding anniversary and Cousin Stickles had friends in to supper on her birthday.

Valancy hated these entertainments because they had to pinch and save and contrive for weeks afterwards to pay for them.

But she wanted to go to the silver wedding.

It would hurt Uncle Herbert’s feelings if she stayed away, and she rather liked Uncle Herbert.

Besides, she wanted to look over all her relatives from her new angle.

It would be an excellent place to make public her declaration  [declaration - декларация] of independence  [independence - независимость] if occasion offered.  

“Put on your brown silk dress,” said Mrs. Stirling.  

As if there were anything else to put on!

Valancy had only the one festive dress—that snuffy-brown silk Aunt Isabel had given her.

Aunt Isabel had decreed that Valancy should never wear colours.

They did not become her.

When she was young they allowed her to wear white, but that had been tacitly dropped for some years.

Valancy put on the brown silk.

It had a high collar and long sleeves.

She had never had a dress with low neck and elbow  [elbow - локоть] sleeves, although they had been worn, even in Deerwood, for over a year.

But she did not do her hair pompadour.

She knotted it on her neck and pulled it out over her ears.

She thought it became her—only the little knot  [knot - узел] was so absurdly small.

Mrs. Frederick did not reflect that this was the first time in her life that she had thought it necessary to consider Valancy’s humours.

But then Valancy had never been “queer” [queer - странный]  before.  

On their way to Uncle Herbert’s—Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles walking in front, Valancy trotting meekly along behind—Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel drove past them.

Drunk  [Drunk - Пьяный] as usual but not in the roaring stage.

Just drunk enough to be excessively polite.

He raised his disreputable old tartan  [tartan - шотландка] cap with the air of a monarch saluting his subjects and swept  [swept - заметанный] them a grand  [grand - великолепный] bow.

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles dared  [dared - смелый] not cut Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel altogether. [altogether - вместе] 

He was the only person in Deerwood who could be got to do odd  [odd - странный] jobs of carpentering and repairing when they needed to be done, so it would not do to offend  [offend - оскорблять] him.

But they responded with only the stiffest, [stiffest - жесткий]  slightest  [slightest - малейший] of bows.

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel must be kept in his place.  

Valancy, behind them, did a thing they were fortunately spared  [spared - пощаженный] seeing.

Only a few nights ago Abel had gone through Deerwood in the wee sma’s, shouting oaths  [oaths - клятвы] at the top of his stentorian voice which could be heard for miles, and lashing his horse into a furious  [furious - разъяренный] gallop as he tore along prim, proper Elm Street.  

“Yelling  [Yelling - Вопящий] and blaspheming like a fiend, [fiend - изверг] ” shuddered Cousin Stickles at the breakfast-table.  

“I cannot understand why the judgment  [judgment - осуждение] of the Lord has not fallen upon that man long ere this,” said Mrs. Frederick petulantly, as if she thought Providence was very dilatory and ought to have a gentle reminder. [reminder - напоминание]   

“He’ll be picked up dead some morning—he’ll fall under his horse’s hoofs and be trampled to death,” said Cousin Stickles reassuringly.  

Valancy had said nothing, of course; but she wondered to herself if Roaring Abel’s periodical sprees were not his futile protest against the poverty and drudgery and monotony  [monotony - однообразие] of his existence.

_

She_ went on dream sprees in her Blue Castle.

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel, having no imagination, could not do that.

_

His_ escapes from reality had to be concrete. [concrete - бетон] 

So she waved at him today with a sudden fellow  [fellow - товарищ] feeling, and Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel, not too drunk to be astonished, [astonished - удивленный]  nearly fell off his seat in his amazement. [amazement - изумление]   

Mrs. Frederick took off her hat in Aunt Alberta’s spare- [spare - пощадить] room with trembling hands.

She made one more feeble attempt to avert  [avert - отвратить] disaster.

She held Valancy back on the landing  [landing - приземлиться] as Cousin Stickles went downstairs.  

“Won’t you try to remember you’re a lady?”

she pleaded. [pleaded - умолять]   

“Oh, if there were only any hope of being able to forget it!” said Valancy wearily.  

Mrs. Frederick felt that she had not deserved this from Providence.     

CHAPTER X   “Bless  [Bless - благословить] this food to our use and consecrate our lives to Thy service,” said Uncle Herbert briskly.  

Aunt Wellington frowned.

She always considered Herbert’s graces  [graces - благодать] entirely too short and “flippant.”

A grace, [grace - благодать]  [grace - благодать]  to be a grace in Aunt Wellington’s eyes, had to be at least three minutes long and uttered  [uttered - произнесенный] in an unearthly  [unearthly - неземной] tone, between a groan and a chant.

As a protest she kept her head bent a perceptible  [perceptible - ощутимый] time after all the rest had been lifted.

When she permitted herself to sit upright  [upright - прямой] she found Valancy looking at her.

Ever afterwards Aunt Wellington averred that she had known from that moment that there was something wrong with Valancy.

In those queer, [queer - странный]  slanted eyes of hers—“we should always have known she was not entirely

_right_

with eyes like that”—there was an odd  [odd - странный] gleam  [gleam - блеск] of mockery and amusement—as if Valancy were laughing at _her_.

Such a thing was unthinkable, of course.

Her clan  [clan - клан] had always considered her very dull. [dull - унылый] 

She had no parlour  [parlour - гостиная] tricks.

And she had been in the habit of taking refuge  [refuge - убежище] from the boredom of family parties in her Blue Castle, which resulted in an absent- [absent - отсутствующий] mindedness that increased her reputation for dulness and vacuity.  

“She has no social presence whatever,” Aunt Wellington had decreed once and for all.

Nobody dreamed that Valancy was dumb  [dumb - немой] in their presence merely  [merely - просто] because she was afraid of them.

Now she was no longer afraid of them.

The shackles had been stricken off her soul.

She was quite prepared to talk if occasion offered.

Meanwhile she was giving herself such freedom of thought as she had never dared  [dared - осмелился] to take before.

She let herself go with a wild, inner exultation, as Uncle Herbert carved  [carved - вырезанный] the turkey.

Uncle Herbert gave Valancy a second look that day.

Being a man, he didn’t know what she had done to her hair, but he thought surprisedly that Doss was not such a bad-looking girl, after all; and he put an extra piece of white meat on her plate.  

“What herb  [herb - трава] is most injurious to a young lady’s beauty?” propounded Uncle Benjamin by way of starting conversation—“loosening things up a bit,” as he would have said.  

Valancy, whose duty it was to say, “What?” did not say it.

Nobody else said it, so Uncle Benjamin, after an expectant  [expectant - ожидающий] pause, had to answer, “Thyme,” and felt that his riddle  [riddle - загадка] had fallen flat.

He looked resentfully at Valancy, who had never failed him before, but Valancy did not seem even to be aware of him.

She was gazing around the table, examining relentlessly every one in this depressing assembly  [assembly - сборка] of sensible  [sensible - разумный] people and watching their little squirms with a detached, amused smile.  

So these were the people she had always held in reverence  [reverence - благоговение] and fear.

She seemed to see them with new eyes.  

Had not her son, Howard, been all through teething at eleven months?

And could she not tell you the best way to do everything, from cooking mushrooms to picking up a snake?

What a bore she was!

What ugly moles she had on her face!  

Cousin Gladys, who was always praising  [praising - восхваляющий] her son, who had died young, and always fighting with her living one.

She had neuritis—or what she called neuritis.

It jumped about from one part of her body to another.

It was a convenient thing.

If anybody wanted her to go somewhere she didn’t want to go she had neuritis in her legs.

And always if any mental effort was required she could have neuritis in her head.

You can’t _think_ with neuritis in your head, my dear. [dear - дорогой]   

“What an old humbug  [humbug - обман] you are!” thought Valancy impiously.  

Aunt Isabel.

Valancy counted her chins.

Aunt Isabel was the critic of the clan. [clan - клан] 

She had always gone about squashing  [squashing - давящий] people flat.

More members of it than Valancy were afraid of her.

She had, it was conceded, [conceded - уступивший]  a biting tongue.  

“I wonder what would happen to your face if you ever smiled,” speculated  [speculated - предполагаемый] Valancy, unblushingly.  

Second Cousin Sarah Taylor, with her great, pale, expressionless  [expressionless - безэмоциональный] eyes, who was noted for the variety of her pickle  [pickle - рассол] recipes  [recipes - рецепты] and for nothing else.

So afraid of saying something indiscreet that she never said anything worth listening to.

So proper that she blushed  [blushed - покрасневший] when she saw the advertisement picture of a corset and had put a dress on her Venus de Milo statuette which made it look “real tasty.”  

Little Cousin Georgiana.

Not such a bad little soul.

But dreary—very.

Always looking as if she had just been starched and ironed.

Always afraid to let herself go.

The only thing she really enjoyed was a funeral. [funeral - похоронный] 

You knew where you were with a corpse.

Nothing more could happen to _it_.

But while there was life there was fear.  

Uncle James.

Handsome, black, with his sarcastic, [sarcastic - саркастический]  trap-like mouth and iron-grey side-burns, whose favourite amusement was to write controversial  [controversial - спорный] letters to the _Christian Times_, attacking Modernism.

Valancy always wondered if he looked as solemn when he was asleep as he did when awake.

No wonder his wife had died young.

Valancy remembered her.

A pretty, sensitive  [sensitive - чувствительный] thing.

Uncle Benjamin, wheezy, pussy-mouthed.

With great pouches under eyes that held nothing in reverence. [reverence - благоговение]   

Uncle Wellington.

Long, pallid face, thin, pale-yellow hair—“one of the fair Stirlings”—thin, stooping body, abominably high forehead with such ugly wrinkles, and “eyes about as intelligent as a fish’s,” thought Valancy.

“Looks like a cartoon of himself.”  

Aunt Wellington.

Named Mary but called by her husband’s name to distinguish  [distinguish - отличать] her from Great-aunt Mary.

A massive, dignified, permanent lady.

Splendidly arranged, iron-grey hair.

Rich, fashionable beaded dress.

Had _her_ moles removed by electrolysis—which Aunt Mildred thought was a wicked  [wicked - злобный] evasion of the purposes of God.  

Uncle Herbert, with his spiky grey hair.

Aunt Alberta, who twisted her mouth so unpleasantly in talking and had a great reputation for unselfishness because she was always giving up a lot of things she didn’t want.

Valancy let them off easily in her judgment  [judgment - суд] because she liked them, even if they were in Milton’s expressive  [expressive - выразительный] phrase, “stupidly good.”

But she wondered for what inscrutable reason Aunt Alberta had seen fit to tie a black velvet ribbon around each of her chubby arms above the elbow. [elbow - локоть]   

Then she looked across the table at Olive.

Olive, who had been held up to her as a paragon of beauty, behaviour and success as long as she could remember.

“Why can’t you hold yourself like Olive, Doss?

Why can’t you stand correctly like Olive, Doss?

Why can’t you speak prettily like Olive, Doss?

Why can’t you make an effort, Doss?”  Valancy’s elfin eyes lost their mocking glitter and became pensive and sorrowful.

You could not ignore or disdain Olive.

It was quite impossible to deny that she was beautiful and effective and sometimes she was a little intelligent.

Her mouth might be a trifle heavy—she might show her fine, white, regular teeth rather too lavishly when she smiled.

But when all was said and done, Olive justified  [justified - оправданный] Uncle Benjamin’s summing up—“a stunning  [stunning - потрясающий] girl.”

Yes, Valancy agreed in her heart, Olive was stunning. [stunning - потрясающий]   

Arms of marble, gleaming through green chiffon and shadow lace. [lace - кружево] 

Valancy felt suddenly thankful that her own scrawny arms were decently swathed in brown silk.

Then she resumed  [resumed - возобновлено] her tabulation of Olive’s charms. [charms - чары]   

Tall.

Queenly.

Confident.

Everything that Valancy was _not_.

Dimples, too, in cheeks  [cheeks - щеки] and chin.

“A woman with dimples always gets her own way,” thought Valancy, in a recurring spasm of bitterness at the fate  [fate - судьба] which had denied her even one dimple.  

Olive was only a year younger than Valancy, though a stranger would have thought that there was at least ten years between them.

But nobody ever dreaded  [dreaded - ужасный] old maidenhood for her.

Olive had been surrounded by a crowd of eager beaus since her early teens, just as her mirror was always surrounded by a fringe of cards, photographs, programmes and invitations.

At eighteen, when she had graduated from Havergal College, Olive had been engaged to Will Desmond, lawyer in embryo. [embryo - эмбрион] 

Will Desmond had died and Olive had mourned for him properly for two years.

When she was twenty-three she had a hectic affair with Donald Jackson.

But Aunt and Uncle Wellington disapproved  [disapproved - неодобренный] of that and in the end Olive dutifully  [dutifully - покорно] gave him up.

Nobody in the Stirling clan— [clan - клан] whatever outsiders  [outsiders - аутсайдеры] might say—hinted that she did so because Donald himself was cooling  [cooling - охлаждение] off.

However that might be, Olive’s third venture  [venture - предприятие] met with everybody’s approval.

Cecil Price was clever and handsome and “one of the Port Lawrence Prices.”

Olive had been engaged to him for three years.

He had just graduated in civil engineering and they were to be married as soon as he landed a contract. [contract - контракт] 

Valancy knew also—though Olive had not told her—that the bridesmaids were selected  [selected - избранные] and that she was not among them.  

Valancy had, after a fashion, always been Olive’s confidante—perhaps because she was the only girl in the connection who could not bore Olive with return confidences.

Olive always told Valancy all the details of her love affairs, from the days when the little boys in school used to “persecute” [persecute - преследовать]  her with love letters.

Valancy could not comfort herself by thinking these affairs mythical.

Olive really had them.

Many men had gone mad over her besides the three fortunate  [fortunate - счастливые] ones.  

“I don’t know what the poor idiots  [idiots - идиоты]  [idiots - идиоты] see in me, that drives them to make such double idiots of themselves,” Olive was wont to say.

Valancy would have liked to say, “I don’t either,” but truth and diplomacy  [diplomacy - дипломатия] both restrained her.

She _did_ know, perfectly well.

Olive Stirling was one of the girls about whom men do go mad just as indubitably as she, Valancy, was one of the girls at whom no man ever looked twice.  

“And yet,” thought Valancy, summing her up with a new and merciless conclusiveness, “she’s like a dewless morning.

There’s _something_ lacking. [lacking - отсутствующие] ”     

CHAPTER XI   

Meanwhile the dinner in its earlier stages was dragging its slow length along true to Stirling form.

The room was chilly, [chilly - холодные]  in spite  [spite - злоба] of the calendar, and Aunt Alberta had the gas-logs lighted.

Everybody in the clan  [clan - клан] envied  [envied - завидующие] her those gas-logs except Valancy.

Glorious  [Glorious - славные] open fires blazed  [blazed - пылающие] in every room of her Blue Castle when autumnal nights were cool, but she would have frozen to death in it before she would have committed the sacrilege  [sacrilege - святотатство] of a gas-log.

Uncle Herbert made his hardy perennial joke when he helped Aunt Wellington to the cold meat—“Mary, will you have a little lamb?”

Aunt Mildred told the same old story of once finding a lost ring in a turkey’s crop.

Uncle Benjamin told _his_ favourite prosy tale of how he had once chased  [chased - преследуемые] and punished a now famous man for stealing apples.

“It spoiled  [spoiled - испорченный] the set.

I could never get it matched.

And it was my wedding-present from dear old Aunt Matilda.”  

Aunt Isabel thought the seasons were changing and couldn’t imagine what had become of our good, old-fashioned springs.

Cousin Georgiana, as usual, discussed the last funeral  [funeral - похоронный] and wondered, audibly, “which of us will be the next to pass away.”

Cousin Georgiana could never say anything as blunt as “die.”

Valancy thought she could tell her, but didn’t.

Cousin Gladys, likewise  [likewise - тоже] as usual, had a grievance.

Her visiting nephews had nipped all the buds  [buds - бутоны] off her house-plants and chivied her brood of fancy chickens—“squeezed

some of them actually to death, my dear. [dear - дорогой] ”  

“Boys will be boys,” reminded Uncle Herbert tolerantly.  

“But they needn’t be ramping, rampageous animals,” retorted Cousin Gladys, looking round the table for appreciation  [appreciation - оценка] of her wit. [wit - остроумие] 

Everybody smiled except Valancy.

Cousin Gladys remembered that.

A few minutes later, when Ellen Hamilton was being discussed, Cousin Gladys spoke of her as “one of those shy, plain girls who can’t get husbands,” and glanced significantly  [significantly - значительно] at Valancy.  

Uncle James thought the conversation was sagging to a rather low plane of personal gossip.

He tried to elevate  [elevate - возвышать] it by starting an abstract  [abstract - абстрактный] discussion on “the greatest happiness.”

Everybody was asked to state  [state - состояние] his or her idea of “the greatest happiness.”  

Aunt Mildred thought the greatest happiness—for a woman—was to be “a loving and beloved  [beloved - любимый] wife and mother.”

Aunt Wellington thought it would be to travel in Europe.

Olive thought it would be to be a great singer like Tetrazzini.

Cousin Gladys remarked mournfully that _her_ greatest happiness would be to be free—absolutely free—from neuritis.

Cousin Georgiana’s greatest happiness would be “to have her dear, dead brother Richard back.”

Aunt Alberta remarked vaguely that the greatest happiness was to be found in “the poetry of life” and hastily  [hastily - наспех] gave some directions to her maid to prevent any one asking her what she meant.

Mrs. Frederick said the greatest happiness was to spend your life in loving service for others, and Cousin Stickles and Aunt Isabel agreed with her—Aunt Isabel with a resentful air, as if she thought Mrs. Frederick had taken the wind out of her sails by saying it first.

“We are all too prone,” continued Mrs. Frederick, determined not to lose so good an opportunity, “to live in selfishness, worldliness and sin. [sin - грех] ”

The other women all felt rebuked for their low ideals, and Uncle James had a conviction  [conviction - убеждение] that the conversation had been uplifted with a vengeance.  

But she deemed  [deemed - считается] it the part of prudence to say nothing.

Uncle Benjamin was not so prudent.

He rashly rushed in where Mrs. Frederick feared  [feared - страшным] to tread. [tread - топтаться]   

“Doss,” he chuckled, “what is the difference between a young girl and an old maid?”  

“One is happy and careless and the other is cappy and hairless,” said Valancy.

“You have asked that riddle  [riddle - загадка] at least fifty times in my recollection, [recollection - воспоминание]  Uncle Ben.

Why don’t you hunt up some new riddles  [riddles - загадки] if riddle you _must_?

It is such a fatal  [fatal - фатальные] mistake to try to be funny if you don’t succeed.”  

Uncle Benjamin stared foolishly. [foolishly - глупо] 

Never in his life had he, Benjamin Stirling, of Stirling and Frost, been spoken to so.

And by Valancy of all people!

He looked feebly around the table to see what the others thought of it.

Everybody was looking rather blank.

Poor Mrs. Frederick had shut her eyes.

And her lips moved tremblingly—as if she were praying.

Perhaps she was.

The situation was so unprecedented  [unprecedented - беспрецедентный] that nobody knew how to meet it.

Valancy went on calmly  [calmly - спокойно] eating her salad as if nothing out of the usual had occurred.  

Aunt Alberta, to save her dinner, plunged  [plunged - погруженный] into an account of how a dog had bitten her recently.

Uncle James, to back her up, asked where the dog had bitten her.  

“Just a little below the Catholic church,” said Aunt Alberta.  

At that point Valancy laughed.

Nobody else laughed.

What was there to laugh at?  

“Is that a vital  [vital - витальный] part?” asked Valancy.  

“What do you mean?” said bewildered  [bewildered - растерянный] Aunt Alberta, and Mrs. Frederick was almost driven to believe that she had served God all her years for naught.  

Aunt Isabel concluded that it was up to her to suppress  [suppress - подавлять] Valancy.  

“Doss, you are horribly thin,” she said.

“You are _all_ corners.

Do you _ever_ try to fatten up a little?”  

“No.”

Valancy was not asking quarter or giving it.

“But I can tell you where you’ll find a beauty parlor in Port Lawrence where they can reduce the number of your chins.”  

“_Val-an-cy_!”

The protest was wrung from Mrs. Frederick.

She meant her tone to be stately  [stately - статный] and majestic, as usual, but it sounded more like an imploring whine.

And she did not say “Doss.”  

“She’s gone dippy, in my opinion,” growled Uncle Benjamin.

“If not, she ought to be spanked.

Yes, spanked.”  

“You can’t spank her.”

Cousin Stickles was much agitated.

“She’s twenty-nine years old.”  

“So there is that advantage, at least, in being twenty-nine,” said Valancy, whose ears had caught this aside. [aside - в стороне]   

“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, “when I am dead you may say what you please.

As long as I am alive I demand to be treated  [treated - обработанный] with respect.”  

“Oh, but you know we’re all dead,” said Valancy, “the whole Stirling clan. [clan - клан] 

Some of us are buried and some aren’t—yet.

That is the only difference.”

“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, thinking it might cow Valancy, “do you remember the time you stole the raspberry jam?”  Valancy flushed scarlet— [scarlet - алый] with suppressed  [suppressed - подавленный] laughter, not shame.

She had been sure Uncle Benjamin would drag that jam in somehow.  

“Of course I do,” she said.

“It was good jam.

I’ve always been sorry I hadn’t time to eat more of it before you found me.

Oh, _look_ at Aunt Isabel’s profile  [profile - профиль] on the wall.

Did you ever see anything so funny?”  

Everybody looked, including Aunt Isabel herself, which of course, destroyed it.

But Uncle Herbert said kindly, “I—I wouldn’t eat any more if I were you, Doss.

It isn’t that I grudge it—but don’t you think it would be better for yourself?

Your—your stomach seems a little out of order.”  

“Don’t worry about my stomach, old dear, [dear - дорогой] ” said Valancy.

“It is all right.

I’m going to keep right on eating.

It’s so seldom  [seldom - редко] I get the chance of a satisfying meal.”  

It was the first time any one had been called “old dear” [dear - дорогой]  in Deerwood.

The Stirlings thought Valancy had invented the phrase and they were afraid of her from that moment.

There was something so uncanny about such an expression.

But in poor Mrs. Frederick’s opinion the reference  [reference - ссылка] to a satisfying meal was the worst thing Valancy had said yet.

Valancy had always been a disappointment  [disappointment - разочарование] to her.

Now she was a disgrace. [disgrace - позор] 

She thought she would have to get up and go away from the table.

Yet she dared not leave Valancy there.  

Aunt Alberta’s maid came in to remove the salad plates and bring in the dessert.

It was a welcome diversion. [diversion - диверсия] 

Everybody brightened up with a determination  [determination - решимость] to ignore Valancy and talk as if she wasn’t there.

Uncle Wellington mentioned Barney Snaith.

Eventually somebody did mention Barney Snaith at every Stirling function, Valancy reflected.

Whatever he was, he was an individual  [individual - индивидуальный] that could not be ignored.

She could feel her pulses  [pulses - импульсы] beating to her finger-tips.  

Of course they abused him.

Nobody ever had a good word to say of Barney Snaith.

All the old, wild tales were canvassed—the defaulting cashier- [cashier - кассир] counterfeiter-infidel-murderer-in-hiding legends  [legends - легенды] were thrashed out.

Uncle Wellington was very indignant that such a creature should be allowed to exist at all in the neighbourhood of Deerwood.

He didn’t know what the police at Port Lawrence were thinking of.

Everybody would be murdered in their beds some night.

It was a shame that he should be allowed to be at large after all that he had done.  

“What _has_ he done?” asked Valancy suddenly.  

Uncle Wellington stared at her, forgetting that she was to be ignored.  

“Done! Done!

He’s done _everything_.”  

“_What_ has he done?” repeated Valancy inexorably.

“What do you _know_ that he has done?

You’re always running him down.

And what has ever been proved against him?”  

“I don’t argue with women,” said Uncle Wellington.

“And I don’t need proof.

When a man hides himself up there on an island in Muskoka, year in and year out, and nobody can find out where he came from or how he lives, or what he does there, _that’s_ proof enough.

Find a mystery and you find a crime.”  

“The very idea of a man named Snaith!” said Second Cousin Sarah.

“Why, the name itself is enough to condemn  [condemn - осуждение] him!”  

“I wouldn’t like to meet him in a dark lane, [lane - переулок] ” shivered Cousin Georgiana.  

“What do you suppose he would do to you?” asked Valancy.  

“Murder me,” said Cousin Georgiana solemnly.  

“Just for the fun of it?” suggested Valancy.  

“Exactly,” said Cousin Georgiana unsuspiciously.

“When there is so much smoke there must be some fire.

I was afraid he was a criminal when he came here first.

I _felt_

he had something to hide.

I am not often mistaken in my intuitions. [intuitions - интуиции] ”  

“Criminal! [Criminal - преступное] 

Of course he’s a criminal,” said Uncle Wellington.

“Nobody doubts  [doubts - сомнения] it”—glaring at Valancy.

“Why, they say he served a term in the penitentiary for embezzlement. [embezzlement - растраты] 

I don’t doubt  [doubt - сомнения] it.

And they say he’s in with that gang  [gang - банда] that are perpetrating all those bank robberies  [robberies - грабежи] round  [round - раунд] the country.”  

“_Who_ say?” asked Valancy.  

Uncle Wellington knotted his ugly forehead at her.

What had got into this confounded girl, anyway?

He ignored the question.  

“He has the identical  [identical - идентичный] look of a jail-bird,” snapped  [snapped - оборвал] Uncle Benjamin.

“I noticed it the first time I saw him.”  

He looked enormously  [enormously - чрезвычайно] pleased over managing to work that quotation  [quotation - цитата] in at last.

He had been waiting all his life for the chance.  

“One of his eyebrows  [eyebrows - брови] is an arch  [arch - арка] and the other is a triangle, [triangle - треугольник] ” said Valancy.

“Is _that_

why you think him so villainous?”  

Uncle James lifted _his_ eyebrows. [eyebrows - брови] 

Generally when Uncle James lifted his eyebrows  [eyebrows - брови] the world came to an end.

This time it continued to function.  

“How do _you_ know his eyebrows  [eyebrows - брови] so well, Doss?” asked Olive, a trifle maliciously.

Such a remark  [remark - замечание] would have covered Valancy with confusion  [confusion - замешательство] two weeks ago, and Olive knew it.  

“Yes, how?” demanded Aunt Wellington.  

“I’ve seen him twice and I looked at him closely,” said Valancy composedly.

“I thought his face the most interesting one I ever saw.”  

“There is no doubt there is something fishy in the creature’s past life,” said Olive, who began to think she was decidedly out of the conversation, which had centred so amazingly  [amazingly - удивительно] around Valancy.

“But he can hardly be guilty of _everything_

he’s accused of, you know.”  

Valancy felt annoyed with Olive.

Why should _she_ speak up in even this qualified defence of Barney Snaith?

What had _she_ to do with him?

For that matter, what had Valancy?

But Valancy did not ask herself this question.  

“They say he keeps dozens of cats in that hut up back on Mistawis,” said Second Cousin Sarah Taylor, by way of appearing not entirely ignorant  [ignorant - невежественное] of him.  

Cats.

It sounded quite alluring to Valancy, in the plural.

She pictured  [pictured - на фото] an island in Muskoka haunted  [haunted - призрачное] by pussies.  

“That alone shows there is something wrong with him,” decreed Aunt Isabel.  

“And if Roaring Abel had kept away from him, as everybody else did, it would have been better for—for some members of his family.”  

Uncle Wellington’s rather lame  [lame - хромой] conclusion was due to a marital glance from Aunt Wellington reminding him of what he had almost forgotten—that there were girls at the table.  

“If you mean,” said Valancy passionately, [passionately - страстно]  “that Barney Snaith is the father of Cecily Gay’s child, he _isn’t_.

It’s a wicked  [wicked - злобный] lie.”  

In spite  [spite - назло] of her indignation Valancy was hugely  [hugely - огромно] amused at the expression of the faces around that festal table.

She had not seen anything like it since the day, seventeen years ago, when at Cousin Gladys’ thimble party, they discovered that she had got—SOMETHING—in her head at school.

_Lice_ in her head!

Valancy was done with euphemisms.  

Poor Mrs. Frederick was almost in a state of collapse.

She had believed—or pretended to believe—that Valancy still supposed that children were found in parsley beds.  

“Hush—hush!” implored Cousin Stickles.  

“I don’t mean to hush,” said Valancy perversely.

“I’ve hush—hushed  [hushed - приглушенный] all my life.

I’ll scream if I want to.

Don’t make me want to.

And stop talking nonsense  [nonsense - ерунда] about Barney Snaith.”  

Valancy didn’t exactly understand her own indignation.

What did Barney Snaith’s imputed crimes and misdemeanours matter to her?

And why, out of them all, did it seem most intolerable that he should have been poor, pitiful little Cecily Gay’s false lover?

For it _did_ seem intolerable to her.

She did not mind when they called him a thief and a counterfeiter and jail-bird; but she could not endure  [endure - терпит] to think that he had loved and ruined Cecily Gay.

She recalled his face on the two occasions of their chance meetings—his twisted, [twisted - скрученный]  enigmatic, engaging smile, his twinkle, [twinkle - мерцание]  his thin, sensitive, [sensitive - чувствительный]  almost ascetic lips, his general air of frank daredeviltry.

A man with such a smile and lips might have murdered or stolen but he could not have betrayed. [betrayed - преданный] 

She suddenly hated every one who said it or believed it of him.  

“When _I_ was a young girl I never thought or spoke about such matters, Doss,” said Aunt Wellington, crushingly.  

“But I’m not a young girl,” retorted Valancy, uncrushed.

“Aren’t you always rubbing  [rubbing - терение] that into me?

And you are all evil- [evil - злобный] minded, [minded - мыслящий]  senseless gossips.

Can’t you leave poor Cissy Gay alone?

She’s dying.

Whatever she did, God or the Devil has punished her enough for it.

_

You_ needn’t take a hand, too.

As for Barney Snaith, the only crime he has been guilty of is living to himself and minding his own business.

He can, it seems, get along without you.

That was exactly what they were and not one of them was fit to mend another.  

“Valancy, your poor father would turn over in his grave if he could hear you,” said Mrs. Frederick.  

“I dare  [dare - сметь] say he would like that for a change,” said Valancy brazenly.  

“Doss,” said Uncle James heavily, “the Ten Commandments are fairly up to date still—especially the fifth.

Have you forgotten that?”  

“No,” said Valancy, “but I thought _you_ had—especially the ninth.

Have you ever thought, Uncle James, how dull  [dull - уныло] life would be without the Ten Commandments?

It is only when things are forbidden  [forbidden - запрещено] that they become fascinating.”  

But her excitement had been too much for her.

She knew, by certain unmistakable  [unmistakable - безошибочно] warnings, that one of her attacks of pain was coming on.

It must not find her there.

She rose from her chair.  

“I am going home now.

I only came for the dinner.

It was very good, Aunt Alberta, although your salad-dressing is not salt enough and a dash  [dash - тире] of cayenne would improve it.”  

None of the flabbergasted silver wedding guests could think of anything to say until the lawn  [lawn - лужайка] gate clanged behind Valancy in the dusk. [dusk - сумерки] 

Then—  “She’s feverish— [feverish - лихорадочный]  [feverish - лихорадочный] I’ve said right along she was feverish,” moaned Cousin Stickles.  

Uncle Benjamin punished his pudgy left hand fiercely  [fiercely - жестоко] with his pudgy right.  

“She’s dippy—I tell you she’s gone dippy,” he snorted angrily.

“That’s all there is about it.

Clean dippy.”  

“Oh, Benjamin,” said Cousin Georgiana soothingly, “don’t condemn  [condemn - осуждать] her too rashly.

We _must_ remember what dear old Shakespeare says—that charity thinketh no evil. [evil - зло] ”  

“Charity!

Poppy-cock!” snorted Uncle Benjamin.

“I never heard a young woman talk such stuff in my life as she just did.

Talking about things she ought to be ashamed to think of, much less mention.

Blaspheming!

Insulting  [Insulting - оскорбительный] _us_!

Uncle Benjamin gulped down the half of a scalding cup of coffee.  

“Do you suppose that the mumps could work on a person that way?” wailed Cousin Stickles.  

“I opened an umbrella in the house yesterday,” sniffed  [sniffed - фыркнул] Cousin Georgiana.

“I _knew_

it betokened some misfortune. [misfortune - несчастье] ”  

“Have you tried to find out if she has a temperature?” asked Cousin Mildred.  

“She wouldn’t let Amelia put the thermometer  [thermometer - градусник] under her tongue,” whimpered Cousin Stickles.  

Mrs. Frederick was openly  [openly - откровенно] in tears.

All her defences were down.  

“I must tell you,” she sobbed, [sobbed - рыдал]  “that Valancy has been acting very strangely for over two weeks now.

She hasn’t been a bit like herself—Christine could tell you.

I have hoped against hope that it was only one of her colds coming on.

But it is—it must be something worse.”  

“This is bringing on my neuritis again,” said Cousin Gladys, putting her hand to her head.  

“Don’t cry, Amelia,” said Herbert kindly, pulling nervously  [nervously - нервно] at his spiky grey hair.

He hated “family ructions.”

Very inconsiderate of Doss to start one at _his_ silver wedding.

Who could have supposed she had it in her?

“You’ll have to take her to a doctor.

This may be only a—er—a brainstorm.

There are such things as brainstorms nowadays, [nowadays - теперь]  aren’t there?”  

“I—I suggested consulting  [consulting - совещался] a doctor to her yesterday,” moaned Mrs. Frederick.

“And she said she wouldn’t go to a doctor—wouldn’t.

Oh, surely I have had trouble enough!”  

“And she _won’t_ take Redfern’s Bitters,” said Cousin Stickles.  

“Or _anything_,” said Mrs. Frederick.  

“And she’s determined  [determined - решительно] to go to the Presbyterian church,” said Cousin Stickles—repressing, [repressing - подавлял]  however, to her credit be it said, the story of the bannister.  

“That proves she’s dippy,” growled Uncle Benjamin.

“I noticed something strange about her the minute she came in today.

I noticed it _before_ today.”

(Uncle Benjamin was thinking of “m-i-r-a-z- [z - з] h.”)

“Everything she said today showed an unbalanced mind.

That question—‘Was it a vital  [vital - жизненно] part?’

Was there any sense at all in that remark? [remark - замечание] 

None whatever!

There never was anything like that in the Stirlings.

It must be from the Wansbarras.”  

Poor Mrs. Frederick was too crushed  [crushed - раздавил] to be indignant.  

“I never heard of anything like that in the Wansbarras,” she sobbed. [sobbed - рыдал]   

“He talked all his life exactly as Valancy did today,” retorted Uncle Benjamin.

“And he believed he was his own great-great grandfather born over again.

I’ve heard him say it.

Don’t tell _me_ that a man who believed a thing like _that_ was ever in his right senses.

Come, come, Amelia, stop sniffling.

Of course Doss has made a terrible exhibition of herself today, but she’s not responsible.

Old maids are apt  [apt - apt] to fly off at a tangent like that.

If she had been married when she should have been she wouldn’t have got like this.”  

“Nobody wanted to marry her,” said Mrs. Frederick, who felt that, somehow, Uncle Benjamin was blaming her.  

“Well, fortunately there’s no outsider  [outsider - аутсайдер] here,” snapped  [snapped - щелкнул] Uncle Benjamin.

“We may keep it in the family yet.

I’ll take her over to see Dr. Marsh tomorrow.

_

I_ know how to deal with pig-headed people.

Won’t that be best, James?”  “We must have medical advice certainly,” agreed Uncle James.  

“Well, that’s settled.

In the meantime, [meantime - тем временем]  Amelia, act as if nothing had happened and keep an eye on her.

Don’t let her be alone.

Above all, don’t let her sleep alone.”  

Renewed  [Renewed - Обновленный] whimpers from Mrs. Frederick.  

“I can’t help it.

Night before last I suggested she’d better have Christine sleep with her.

She positively refused—_and locked her door_.

Oh, you don’t know how she’s changed.

She won’t work.

At least, she won’t sew.

She does her usual housework, of course.

But she wouldn’t sweep  [sweep - подметать]  [sweep - подметать] the parlour  [parlour - гостиная] yesterday morning, though we _always_ sweep it on Thursdays.

She said she’d wait till it was dirty.

‘Would you rather sweep  [sweep - подметать] a dirty room than a clean one?’

I asked her.

She said, ‘Of course.

I’d see something for my labour  [labour - труд] then.’

Think of it!”  

Uncle Benjamin thought of it.  

“The jar of potpourri”—Cousin Stickles pronounced it as spelled—“has disappeared from her room.

I found the pieces in the next lot.

She won’t tell us what happened to it.”  

“I should never have dreamed it of Doss,” said Uncle Herbert.

“She has always seemed such a quiet, sensible  [sensible - разумный] girl.

A bit backward— [backward - отсталый] but sensible. [sensible - разумный] ”  

“The only thing you can be sure of in this world is the multiplication table,” said Uncle James, feeling cleverer than ever.  

“Well, let’s cheer up,” suggested Uncle Benjamin.

“Why are chorus girls like fine stock  [stock - запас] raisers?”  

“Why?” asked Cousin Stickles, since it had to be asked and Valancy wasn’t there to ask it.  

“Like to exhibit  [exhibit - экспонат] calves,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin.  Cousin Stickles thought Uncle Benjamin a little indelicate.

Before Olive, too.

But then, he was a man.  

The attack she had when she thankfully  [thankfully - к счастью] reached the shelter of her own room was the worst yet.

It was really very bad.

She might die in one of those spells. [spells - заклинания] 

It would be dreadful  [dreadful - ужасно] to die in such pain.

Perhaps—perhaps this was death.

Valancy felt pitifully alone.

When she could think at all she wondered what it would be like to have some one with her who could sympathise—some one who really cared—just to hold her hand tight, [tight - туго]  if nothing else—some one just to say, “Yes, I know.

It’s dreadful— [dreadful - ужасно] be brave—you’ll soon be better;” not some one merely  [merely - просто] fussy and alarmed. [alarmed - встревожено] 

Not her mother or Cousin Stickles.

Why did the thought of Barney Snaith come into her mind?

Why did she suddenly feel, in the midst  [midst - посреди] of this hideous loneliness  [loneliness - одиночества] of pain, that _he_ would be sympathetic— [sympathetic - сочувственно] sorry for any one that was suffering?

Why did he seem to her like an old, well-known friend?

Was it because she had been defending him—standing up to her family for him?  

She was so bad at first that she could not even get herself a dose  [dose - доза] of Dr. Trent’s prescription. [prescription - рецепт] 

But eventually she managed it, and soon after relief  [relief - облегчение] came.

The pain left her and she lay on her bed, spent, exhausted, [exhausted - истощение]  in a cold perspiration. [perspiration - пот] 

Oh, that had been horrible!

But to be hurt so in dying!  

Suddenly she found herself laughing.

That dinner _had_ been fun.

And it had all been so simple.

She had merely  [merely - просто] _said_

the things she had always _thought_.

Their faces—oh, their faces!

Uncle Benjamin—poor, flabbergasted Uncle Benjamin!

Valancy felt quite sure he would make a new will that very night.

Olive would get Valancy’s share of his fat hoard.

Olive had always got Valancy’s share of everything.

Remember the dust-pile.  

To laugh at her clan  [clan - клан] as she had always wanted to laugh was all the satisfaction  [satisfaction - удовлетворение] she could get out of life now.

But she thought it was rather pitiful that it should be so.

Might she not pity herself a little when nobody else did?  

Valancy got up and went to her window.

The moist, beautiful wind blowing across groves of young-leafed wild trees touched her face with the caress of a wise, tender, [tender - нежный]  old friend.

The lombardies in Mrs. Tredgold’s lawn, [lawn - лужайка]  off to the left—Valancy could just see them between the stable and the old carriage- [carriage - карета] shop—were in dark purple silhouette  [silhouette - силуэт] against a clear sky and there was a milk-white, pulsating star just over one of them, like a living pearl  [pearl - жемчуг] on a silver-green lake.

Far beyond the station were the shadowy, purple-hooded woods around Lake Mistawis.

A white, filmy mist  [mist - туман] hung over them and just above it was a faint, young crescent.

Valancy looked at it over her thin left shoulder.  

“I wish,” she said whimsically, “that I may have _one_ little dust-pile before I die.”     

CHAPTER XIII   Uncle Benjamin found he had reckoned  [reckoned - посчитался] without his host when he promised so airily to take Valancy to a doctor.

Valancy would not go.

Valancy laughed in his face.  

“Why on earth should I go to Dr. Marsh?

There’s nothing the matter with my mind.

Though you all think I’ve suddenly gone crazy.

Well, I haven’t.

I’ve simply grown tired of living to please other people and have decided to please myself.

It will give you something to talk about besides my stealing the raspberry jam.

So that’s that.”  

“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, solemnly and helplessly, [helplessly - беспомощно]  “you are not—like yourself.”  

“Who am I like, then?” asked Valancy.  

Uncle Benjamin was rather posed. [posed - позировал]   

“Your Grandfather Wansbarra,” he answered desperately. [desperately - отчаянно]   

“Thanks.”

Valancy looked pleased.

“That’s a real compliment.

I remember Grandfather Wansbarra.

He was one of the few human beings I _have_ known—almost the only one.

Now, it is of no use to scold or entreat or command, Uncle Benjamin—or exchange anguished glances with Mother and Cousin Stickles.

I am not going to any doctor.

And if you bring any doctor here I won’t see him.

So what are you going to do about it?”  

What indeed!

It was not seemly—or even possible—to hale Valancy doctorwards by physical force.

And in no other way could it be done, seemingly. [seemingly - видимо] 

Her mother’s tears and imploring entreaties availed not.  

“Don’t worry, Mother,” said Valancy, lightly but quite respectfully. [respectfully - уважительно] 

“It isn’t likely I’ll do anything very terrible.

But I mean to have a little fun.”  

“Fun!”

Olive, sent by her mother to see if _she_ had any influence over Valancy, came away with flushed cheeks  [cheeks - щеки] and angry eyes.

She told her mother that nothing could be done with Valancy.

After _she_, Olive, had talked to her just like a sister, tenderly and wisely, all Valancy had said, narrowing her funny eyes to mere  [mere - просто] slips, was, “_I_ don’t show my gums  [gums - десны] when I laugh.”  

“More as if she were talking to herself than to me.

Indeed, Mother, all the time I was talking to her she gave me the impression of not really listening.

And that wasn’t all.

When I finally decided that what I was saying had no influence over her I begged her, when Cecil came next week, not to say anything queer  [queer - педик] before him, at least.

Mother, what do you think she said?”  

“I’m sure I can’t imagine,” groaned Aunt Wellington, prepared for anything.  

“She said, ‘I’d rather like to shock  [shock - шок] Cecil.

His mouth is too red for a man’s.’

Mother, I can never feel the same to Valancy again.”  

“Her mind is affected, Olive,” said Aunt Wellington solemnly.

“You must not hold her responsible for what she says.”  

When Aunt Wellington told Mrs. Frederick what Valancy had said to Olive, Mrs. Frederick wanted Valancy to apologise.  

“You made me apologise to Olive fifteen years ago for something I didn’t do,” said Valancy.

“That old apology  [apology - извинения] will do for now.”  

Another solemn family conclave was held.

They were all there except Cousin Gladys, who had been suffering such tortures of neuritis in her head “ever since poor Doss went queer” [queer - педик]  that she couldn’t undertake  [undertake - предпринимать] any responsibility.

They decided—that is, they accepted a fact that was thrust in their faces—that the wisest thing was to leave Valancy alone for a while—“give her her head” as Uncle Benjamin expressed it—“keep a careful eye on her but let her pretty much alone.”

The term of “watchful waiting” [waiting - ожидание]  had not been invented then, but that was practically  [practically - практически] the policy Valancy’s distracted relatives decided to follow.  

“We must be guided by developments,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“It is”—solemnly—“easier to scramble  [scramble - карабкаться] eggs than unscramble them.

Of course—if she becomes violent——”  Uncle James consulted  [consulted - советоваться] Dr. Ambrose Marsh.

Dr. Ambrose Marsh approved their decision.

He pointed out to irate Uncle James—who would have liked to lock Valancy up somewhere, out of hand—that Valancy had not, as yet, really done or said anything that could be construed as proof of lunacy—and without proof you cannot lock people up in this degenerate age.

Nothing that Uncle James had reported seemed very alarming  [alarming - тревожить] to Dr. Marsh, who put up his hand to conceal  [conceal - скрывать] a smile several times.

But then he himself was not a Stirling.

And he knew very little about the old Valancy.

Uncle James stalked out and drove back to Deerwood, thinking that Ambrose Marsh wasn’t much of a doctor, after all, and that Adelaide Stirling might have done better for herself.     

CHAPTER XIV   Life cannot stop because tragedy  [tragedy - трагедия] enters it.

Roaring  [Roaring - Рев]  [Roaring - Рев] Abel had been engaged to do it many moons before and Roaring Abel promptly  [promptly - незамедлительно] appeared on the morning of the first day of the second week, and fell to work.

Of course he was drunk.

Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel was never anything but drunk.

But he was only in the first stage, which made him talkative and genial.

The odour of whisky on his breath nearly drove Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles wild at dinner.

Even Valancy, with all her emancipation, did not like it.

But she liked Abel and she liked his vivid, eloquent  [eloquent - красноречивый] talk, and after she washed the dinner dishes she went out and sat on the steps and talked to him.  

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles thought it a terrible proceeding, but what could they do?

Valancy only smiled mockingly at them when they called her in, and did not go.

It was so easy to defy  [defy - вопреки] once you got started.

The first step was the only one that really counted.

They were both afraid to say anything more to her lest she might make a scene before Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel, who would spread  [spread - разброс] it all over the country with his own characteristic  [characteristic - характеристики] comments and exaggerations. [exaggerations - преувеличения] 

It was too cold a day, in spite  [spite - злоба] of the June sunshine, for Mrs. Frederick to sit at the dining-room window and listen to what was said.

She had to shut the window and Valancy and Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel had their talk to themselves.

Valancy liked to hear him.

Every stroke  [stroke - мазок] of his hammer fell true to the note.  

Old Abel Gay, in spite  [spite - злоба] of his seventy years, was handsome still, in a stately, [stately - статный]  patriarchal manner.

His tremendous  [tremendous - огромный] beard, falling down over his blue flannel shirt, was still a flaming, [flaming - пылающий]  untouched  [untouched - нетронутый] red, though his shock of hair was white as snow, and his eyes were a fiery, youthful  [youthful - юношеский] blue.

His enormous, reddish- [reddish - рыжеватый] white eyebrows  [eyebrows - брови]  [eyebrows - брови] were more like moustaches than eyebrows.

Perhaps this was why he always kept his upper lip scrupulously shaved.

His cheeks  [cheeks - щеки] were red and his nose ought to have been, but wasn’t.

It was a fine, upstanding, aquiline nose, such as the noblest  [noblest - благороднейший] Roman of them all might have rejoiced in.

Abel was six feet two in his stockings, broad-shouldered, lean-hipped.

In his youth he had been a famous lover, finding all women too charming  [charming - прелестный] to bind  [bind - связать] himself to one.

He had been forty-five before he married—a pretty slip of a girl whom his goings-on killed in a few years.

Abel was piously drunk at her funeral  [funeral - похороны] and insisted on repeating the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah—Abel knew most of the Bible and all the Psalms by heart—while the minister, [minister - министр]  whom he disliked, prayed or tried to pray.

Thereafter his house was run by an untidy old cousin who cooked his meals and kept things going after a fashion.

In this unpromising environment  [environment - окружающая среда] little Cecilia Gay had grown up.  

Valancy had known “Cissy Gay” fairly well in the democracy  [democracy - демократия] of the public school, though Cissy had been three years younger than she.

After they left school their paths diverged  [diverged - разошлись] and she had seen nothing of her.

Old Abel was a Presbyterian.

That is, he got a Presbyterian preacher  [preacher - проповедник] to marry him, baptise his child and bury his wife; and he knew more about Presbyterian theology  [theology - богословие] than most ministers, [ministers - министры]  which made him a terror  [terror - террор] to them in arguments.

But Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel never went to church.

Every Presbyterian minister  [minister - министр] who had been in Deerwood had tried his hand—once—at reforming Roaring Abel.

But he had not been pestered of late.

Rev. Mr. Bently had been in Deerwood for eight years, but he had not sought out Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel since the first three months of his pastorate.

Abel never went beyond it.

He generally fell asleep on his knees and awakened sober, [sober - трезвый]  but he had never been “dead drunk” in his life.

He told Mr. Bently that he was a sound  [sound - здравый] Presbyterian and sure of his election.

He had no sins— [sins - грехи] that he knew of—to repent of.  

“Have you never done anything in your life that you are sorry for?” asked Mr. Bently.  

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel scratched  [scratched - царапанный] his bushy white head and pretended to reflect.

“Well, yes,” he said finally.

“There were some women I might have kissed and didn’t.

I’ve always been sorry for _that_.”  

Mr. Bently went out and went home.  

Abel had seen that Cissy was properly baptised—jovially drunk at the same time himself.

He made her go to church and Sunday School regularly.

The church people took her up and she was in turn a member of the Mission Band, the Girls’ Guild and the Young Women’s Missionary Society.

She was a faithful, unobtrusive, sincere, [sincere - искренний]  little worker.

Everybody liked Cissy Gay and was sorry for her.

She was so modest  [modest - скромный] and sensitive  [sensitive - чувствительный] and pretty in that delicate, [delicate - нежный]  elusive  [elusive - неуловимый] fashion of beauty which fades  [fades - меркнет] so quickly if life is not kept in it by love and tenderness. [tenderness - нежность] 

But then liking and pity  [pity - жалость] did not prevent them from tearing her in pieces like hungry cats when the catastrophe  [catastrophe - катастрофа] came.

Four years previously  [previously - ранее] Cissy Gay had gone up to a Muskoka hotel as a summer waitress.

And when she had come back in the fall she was a changed creature.

She hid herself away and went nowhere.

That winter Cissy’s baby was born.

Nobody ever knew who the father was.

Cecily kept her poor pale lips tightly locked on her sorry secret.

Nobody dared  [dared - смел] ask Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel any questions about it.

Rumour  [Rumour - Слух] and surmise laid the guilt  [guilt - вина] at Barney Snaith’s door because diligent inquiry  [inquiry - дознание] among the other maids at the hotel revealed the fact that nobody there had ever seen Cissy Gay “with a fellow.”

She had “kept herself to herself” they said, rather resentfully.

“Too good for _our_ dances.

And now look!”  

The baby had lived for a year.

After its death Cissy faded  [faded - увяло] away.

Two years ago Dr. Marsh had given her only six months to live—her lungs were hopelessly  [hopelessly - безнадежно] diseased.

But she was still alive.

Nobody went to see her.

Women would not go to Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel’s house.

Mr. Bently had gone once, when he knew Abel was away, but the dreadful  [dreadful - ужасно] old creature who was scrubbing the kitchen floor told him Cissy wouldn’t see any one.

The old cousin had died and Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel had had two or three disreputable housekeepers— [housekeepers - домохозяйки] the only kind who could be prevailed  [prevailed - победил] on to go to a house where a girl was dying of consumption. [consumption - чахотка] 

But the last one had left and Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel had now no one to wait on Cissy and “do” for him.

Was Valancy listening to _that_?  

Valancy hardly noticed the profanity. [profanity - ненормативная лексика] 

Her attention was focussed on the horrible thought of poor, unhappy, disgraced little Cissy Gay, ill and helpless in that forlorn old house out on the Mistawis road, without a soul to help or comfort her.

And this in a nominally Christian community  [community - сообщество] in the year of grace  [grace - изящество] nineteen and some odd! [odd - нечетные]   

“Do you mean to say that Cissy is all alone there now, with nobody to do anything for her—_nobody_?”  

“Oh, she can move about a bit and get a bite and sup when she wants it.

But she can’t work.

It’s d——d hard for a man to work hard all day and go home at night tired and hungry and cook his own meals.

Sometimes I’m sorry I kicked old Rachel Edwards out.”

Abel described Rachel picturesquely.  

“Her face looked as if it had wore out a hundred bodies.

And she moped.

Talk about temper!

Temper’s nothing to moping.

She was too slow to catch worms, [worms - черви]  and dirty—d——d dirty.

I ain’t unreasonable— [unreasonable - неразумный] I know a man has to eat his peck before he dies—but she went over the limit.

What d’ye sp’ose I saw that lady do?

She’d made some punkin jam—had it on the table in glass jars with the tops off.

The dawg got up on the table and stuck his paw  [paw - лапа] into one of them.

What did she do?

She jest took holt of the dawg and wrung the syrup  [syrup - сироп] off his paw  [paw - лапа] back into the jar!

Then screwed  [screwed - облажались] the top on and set it in the pantry.

I sets open the door and says to her, ‘Go!’

The dame went, and I fired  [fired - уволили] the jars of punkin after her, two at a time.

Thought I’d die laughing to see old Rachel run—with them punkin jars raining after her.

She’s told everywhere I’m crazy, so nobody’ll come for love or money.”  

“But Cissy _must_ have some one to look after her,” insisted Valancy, whose mind was centred on this aspect of the case.

She did not care whether Roaring Abel had any one to cook for him or not.

But her heart was wrung for Cecilia Gay.  

“Oh, she gits on.

Barney Snaith always drops in when he’s passing and does anything she wants done.

Brings her oranges and flowers and things.

There’s a Christian for you.

Yet that sanctimonious, snivelling parcel of St. Andrew’s people wouldn’t be seen on the same side of the road with him.

Their dogs’ll go to heaven before they do.

And their minister— [minister - министр] slick as if the cat had licked  [licked - вылизали] him!”  

“There are plenty of good people, both in St. Andrew’s and St. George’s, who would be kind to Cissy if you would behave yourself,” said Valancy severely. [severely - сильно] 

“They’re afraid to go near your place.”  

“Because I’m such a sad old dog?

But I don’t bite—never bit any one in my life.

A few loose words spilled  [spilled - пролил] around don’t hurt any one.

And I’m not asking people to come.

Don’t want ’em poking and prying about.

I’d be respectable then.

But what’s the use of going to church when it’s all settled by predestination?

Tell me that, Miss.”  “Is it?” said Valancy.  

“Yes. Can’t git around it nohow.

Wish I could.

I don’t want either heaven or hell  [hell - ад] for steady.

Wish a man could have ’em mixed in equal proportions. [proportions - пропорции] ”  

“Isn’t that the way it is in this world?” said.

Valancy thoughtfully— [thoughtfully - задумчиво] but rather as if her thought was concerned  [concerned - обеспокоен] with something else than theology. [theology - теология]   

“No, no,” boomed Abel, striking a tremendous  [tremendous - огромный] blow  [blow - удар] on a stubborn nail.

“There’s too much hell  [hell - ад]  [hell - ад] here—entirely too much hell.

That’s why I get drunk so often.

It sets you free for a little while—free from yourself—yes, by God, free from predestination.

Ever try it?”  

“No, I’ve another way of getting free,” said Valancy absently.

“But about Cissy now.

She _must_ have some one to look after her——”  “What are you harping on Sis for?

Seems to me you ain’t bothered much about her up to now.

You never even come to see her.

And she used to like you so well.”  

“I should have,” said Valancy.

“But never mind.

You couldn’t understand.

The point is—you must have a housekeeper. [housekeeper - экономка] ”  

“Where am I to get one?

I can pay decent  [decent - достойная]  [decent - достойная] wages  [wages - зарплата] if I could get a decent woman.

D’ye think I like old hags?”  “Will I do?” said Valancy.     

CHAPTER XV   “Let us be calm,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“Let us be perfectly calm.”  

“Calm!”

Mrs. Frederick wrung her hands.

“How can I be calm—how could anybody be calm under such a disgrace  [disgrace - позор] as this?”  

“Why in the world did you let her go?” asked Uncle James.  

“_Let_ her!

How could I stop her, James?

It seems she packed the big valise and sent it away with Roaring Abel when he went home after supper, while Christine and I were out in the kitchen.

Then Doss herself came down with her little satchel, dressed in her green serge suit.

I felt a terrible premonition.

I can’t tell you how it was, but I seemed to _know_ that Doss was going to do something dreadful. [dreadful - ужасный] ”  

“And _I_ said, ‘Valancy, what _do_

you mean?’

And _she_ said, ‘I am going to keep house for Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel and nurse Cissy.

He will pay me thirty dollars a month.’

I wonder I didn’t drop dead on the spot.”  

“You shouldn’t have let her go—you shouldn’t have let her out of the house,” said Uncle James.

“You should have locked the door—anything——”  “She was between me and the front door.

And you can’t realise how determined  [determined - решительный] she was.

She was like a rock.

That’s the strangest thing of all about her.

She used to be so good and obedient, [obedient - послушный]  and now she’s neither to hold nor bind. [bind - связать] 

But I said _everything_

I could think of to bring her to her senses.

I asked her if she had no regard  [regard - уважение] for her reputation.

I said to her solemnly, ‘Doss, when a woman’s reputation is once smirched nothing can ever make it spotless again.

Your character will be gone for ever if you go to Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel’s to wait on a bad girl like Sis Gay.’

And she said, ‘I don’t believe Cissy was a bad girl, but I don’t care if she was.’

Those were her very words, ‘I don’t care if she was.’”  

“She has lost all sense of decency,” exploded  [exploded - взорвался] Uncle Benjamin.  

“‘Cissy Gay is dying,’ she said, ‘and it’s a shame and disgrace  [disgrace - позор] that she is dying in a Christian community  [community - сообщество] with no one to do anything for her.

Whatever she’s been or done, she’s a human being.’”  

“Well, you know, when it comes to that, I suppose she is,” said Uncle James with the air of one making a splendid concession. [concession - уступка]   

“I asked Doss if she had no regard  [regard - уважение] for appearances.

She said, ‘I’ve been keeping up appearances all my life.

Now I’m going in for realities.

Appearances can go hang!’

Go _hang_!”  

“An outrageous  [outrageous - возмутительный] thing!” said Uncle Benjamin violently.

“An outrageous  [outrageous - возмутительный] thing!”  

Which relieved  [relieved - с облегчением] his feelings, but didn’t help any one else.  

Mrs. Frederick wept.

Cousin Stickles took up the refrain  [refrain - припев] between her moans of despair.  

She laughed and said, ‘I’m not afraid of Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel.

He won’t kill _me_, and he’s too old for me to be afraid of his gallantries.’

What did she mean?

What _are_ gallantries?”  

Mrs. Frederick saw that she must stop crying if she wanted to regain  [regain - восстановить] control of the conversation.  

“_I_ said to her, ‘Valancy, if you have no regard  [regard - уважение] for your own reputation and your family’s standing, have you none for _my_ feelings?’

She said, ‘None.’

Just like that, ‘_None_!’”  

“Insane people never _do_ have any regard  [regard - уважение] for other people’s feelings,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“That’s one of the symptoms.”  

“I broke out into tears then, and she said, ‘Come now, Mother, be a good sport.

I’m going to do an act of Christian charity, and as for the damage it will do my reputation, why, you know I haven’t any matrimonial chances anyhow, so what does it matter?’

And with that she turned and went out.”  

“The last words I said to her,” said Cousin Stickles pathetically, “were, ‘Who will rub  [rub - тереть] my back at nights now?’

And she said—she said—but no, I cannot repeat it.”  

“Nonsense, [Nonsense - Чепуха] ” said Uncle Benjamin.

“Out with it.

This is no time to be squeamish.”  

“She said”—Cousin

Stickles’ voice was little more than a whisper—“she said—‘Oh, _darn_!’”  

“To think I should have lived to hear my daughter swearing!” sobbed  [sobbed - всхлипывать] Mrs. Frederick.  

“It—it was only imitation  [imitation - подражание] swearing,” faltered  [faltered - запинаться] Cousin Stickles, desirous of smoothing things over now that the worst was out.

But she had _never_ told about the bannister.  

“It will be only a step from that to real swearing,” said Uncle James sternly.  

“The worst of this”—Mrs.

Frederick hunted for a dry spot on her handkerchief—“is that every one will know now that she is deranged.

We can’t keep it a secret any longer.

Oh, I cannot bear it!”  

“You should have been stricter with her when she was young,” said Uncle Benjamin.  

“I don’t see how I could have been,” said Mrs. Frederick—truthfully enough.  

“The worst feature of the case is that Snaith scoundrel is always hanging around Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel’s,” said Uncle James.

“I shall be thankful if nothing worse comes of this mad freak than a few weeks at Roaring Abel’s.

Cissy Gay _can’t_ live much longer.”  

“And she didn’t even take her flannel petticoat!”

lamented Cousin Stickles.  

“I’ll see Ambrose Marsh again about this,” said Uncle Benjamin—meaning Valancy, not the flannel petticoat.  

“I’ll see Lawyer Ferguson,” said Uncle James.  

“Meanwhile,” added Uncle Benjamin, “let us be calm.”     

CHAPTER XVI   Valancy had walked out to Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel’s house on the Mistawis road under a sky of purple and amber, with a queer  [queer - странный] exhilaration  [exhilaration - волнение] and expectancy in her heart.

Back there, behind her, her mother and Cousin Stickles were crying—over themselves, not over her.

But here the wind was in her face, soft, dew-wet, cool, blowing along the grassy roads.

Oh, she loved the wind!

The robins were whistling  [whistling - свист] sleepily in the firs along the way and the moist air was fragrant with the tang of balsam.

Muskoka cottages  [cottages - коттеджи] might be charming, [charming - очаровательный]  but beyond, in the sunset skies, among the spires of the firs, her Blue Castle towered.

She brushed the old years and habits and inhibitions away from her like dead leaves.

She would not be littered with them.  

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel’s rambling, tumble-down old house was situated about three miles from the village, on the very edge of “up back,” as the sparsely  [sparsely - редко] settled, hilly, wooded  [wooded - лесистый] country around Mistawis was called vernacularly.

It did not, it must be confessed, [confessed - признанный]  look much like a Blue Castle.  

It had once been a snug place enough in the days when Abel Gay had been young and prosperous, and the punning, arched sign over the gate—“A. Gay, Carpenter,” had been fine and freshly painted.

Now it was a faded, dreary old place, with a leprous, patched roof and shutters hanging askew.

Abel never seemed to do any carpenter  [carpenter - плотник] jobs about his own house.

It had a listless air, as if tired of life.

There was a dwindling grove of ragged, crone-like old spruces behind it.

The garden, which Cissy used to keep neat  [neat - аккуратный] and pretty, had run wild.

On two sides of the house were fields full of nothing but mulleins.

Behind the house was a long stretch of useless  [useless - бесполезный] barrens, full of scrub pines  [pines - сосны] and spruces, with here and there a blossoming bit of wild cherry, [cherry - вишня]  running back to a belt of timber  [timber - бревен] on the shores  [shores - берега] of Lake Mistawis, two miles away.

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel met Valancy at the door.  

“So you’ve come,” he said incredulously.

“I never s’posed that ruck of Stirlings would let you.”  

Valancy showed all her pointed teeth in a grin. [grin - ухмылка]   

“They couldn’t stop me.”  

“I didn’t think you’d so much spunk,” said Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel admiringly. [admiringly - восхищенно] 

“And look at the nice ankles of her,” he added, as he stepped aside  [aside - в сторону] to let her in.  

If Cousin Stickles had heard this she would have been certain that Valancy’s doom, [doom - гибель]  earthly and unearthly, [unearthly - неземной]  was sealed.

But Abel’s superannuated gallantry did not worry Valancy.

Besides, this was the first compliment she had ever received in her life and she found herself liking it.

She sometimes suspected  [suspected - подозреваемый] she had nice ankles, but nobody had ever mentioned it before.

In the Stirling clan  [clan - клан] ankles were among the unmentionables.  

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel took her into the kitchen, where Cissy Gay was lying on the sofa, breathing quickly, with little scarlet spots on her hollow  [hollow - впалые] cheeks. [cheeks - щеки] 

Valancy had not seen Cecilia Gay for years.

Then she had been such a pretty creature, a slight, [slight - легкий]  blossom- [blossom - цветок] like girl, with soft, golden  [golden - золотой] hair, clear-cut, almost waxen features, and large, beautiful blue eyes.

She was shocked at the change in her.

Could this be sweet Cissy—this pitiful little thing that looked like a tired, broken flower?

She had wept all the beauty out of her eyes; they looked too big—enormous—in her wasted face.

The contrast was so terrible that Valancy’s own eyes filled with tears.

She knelt  [knelt - встал на колени] down by Cissy and put her arms about her.  

“Cissy dear, I’ve come to look after you.

I’ll stay with you till—till—as long as you want me.”  

“Oh!”

Cissy put her thin arms about Valancy’s neck.

“Oh—_will_ you?

It’s been so—lonely.

I can wait on myself—but it’s been so _lonely_.

It—would just be like—heaven—to have some one here—like you.

You were always—so sweet to me—long ago.”  

Valancy held Cissy close.

She was suddenly happy.

Here was some one who needed her—some one she could help.

She was no longer a superfluity.

Old things had passed away; everything had become new.  

“Most things are predestinated, but some are just darn sheer  [sheer - отвесный] luck,” said Roaring Abel, complacently smoking his pipe in the corner.     

CHAPTER XVII   When Valancy had lived for a week at Roaring Abel’s she felt as if years had separated  [separated - отделенный] her from her old life and all the people she had known in it.

They were beginning to seem remote—dream-like—far-away—and as the days went on they seemed still more so, until they ceased  [ceased - прекратившийся] to matter altogether. [altogether - совсем]   

She was happy.

Nobody ever bothered her with conundrums or insisted on giving her Purple Pills.

Nobody called her Doss or worried her about catching cold.

There were no quilts to piece, no abominable rubber-plant to water, no ice-cold maternal  [maternal - материнский] tantrums  [tantrums - истерики] to endure. [endure - терпит] 

She could be alone whenever she liked, go to bed when she liked, sneeze  [sneeze - чих] when she liked.

Sometimes of an afternoon, when Cissy was strong enough, the two girls went into the barrens and looked at the wood-flowers.

But they did not pick any.

Valancy had read to Cissy the gospel thereof according to John Foster: “It is a pity  [pity - жалость] to gather wood-flowers.

They lose half their witchery away from the green and the flicker. [flicker - мерцание] 

The way to enjoy wood-flowers is to track  [track - трек] them down to their remote haunts—gloat over them—and then leave them with backward glances, taking with us only the beguiling  [beguiling - обманчивый] memory of their grace  [grace - изящество] and fragrance. [fragrance - аромат] ”  

Valancy was in the midst  [midst - середина] of realities after a lifetime  [lifetime - время жизни] of unrealities.

And busy—very busy.

The house had to be cleaned.

Not for nothing had Valancy been brought up in the Stirling habits of neatness and cleanliness. [cleanliness - чистота] 

If she found satisfaction  [satisfaction - удовлетворение] in cleaning dirty rooms she got her fill of it there.

Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel thought she was foolish to bother doing so much more than she was asked to do, but he did not interfere  [interfere - мешать] with her.

He was very well satisfied with his bargain. [bargain - сделка] 

Valancy was a good cook.

Abel said she got a flavour  [flavour - аромат] into things.

The only fault he found with her was that she did not sing at her work.  

“Folks should always sing at their work,” he insisted.

“Sounds cheerful-like.”  

“Not always,” retorted Valancy.

“Fancy a butcher singing at his work.

Or an undertaker.”  

Abel burst  [burst - взрыв] into his great broad laugh.  

“There’s no getting the better of you.

You’ve got an answer every time.

I should think the Stirlings would be glad to be rid of you.

_

They_ don’t like being sassed back.”  

During the day Abel was generally away from home—if not working, then shooting or fishing with Barney Snaith.

He generally came home at nights—always very late and often very drunk.

The first night they heard him come howling into the yard, Cissy had told Valancy not to be afraid.  

“Father never does anything—he just makes a noise.”  

For the most part, Abel was a good-natured creature, but occasionally he had a temper.

Once Valancy asked him coolly:  “What is the use of getting in a rage? [rage - ярость] ”  “It’s such a d——d relief, [relief - облегчение] ” said Abel.  

They both burst  [burst - взрыв] out laughing together.  

“You’re a great little sport,” said Abel admiringly. [admiringly - восхищенно] 

“Don’t mind my bad French.

I don’t mean a thing by it.

Jest habit.

Say, I like a woman that ain’t afraid to speak up to me.

Sis there was always too meek—too meek.

That’s why she got adrift.

I like you.”  

“All the same,” said Valancy determinedly, “there is no use in sending things to hell  [hell - ад] as you’re always doing.

And I’m _not_ going to have you tracking  [tracking - отслеживание] mud all over a floor I’ve just scrubbed.

You _must_

use the scraper whether you consign it to perdition or not.”  

Cissy loved the cleanness and neatness.

She had kept it so, too, until her strength failed.

She was very pitifully happy because she had Valancy with her.

It had been so terrible—the long, lonely days and nights with no companionship  [companionship - общение] save those dreadful  [dreadful - ужасный] old women who came to work.

Cissy had hated and feared  [feared - страшный] them.

She clung  [clung - цепляющийся] to Valancy like a child.  

There was no doubt that Cissy was dying.

Yet at no time did she seem alarmingly ill.

She did not even cough a great deal.

Most days she was able to get up and dress—sometimes even to work about in the garden or the barrens for an hour or two.

For a few weeks after Valancy’s coming  [coming - приближающийся] she seemed so much better that Valancy began to hope she might get well.

But Cissy shook her head.  

“No, I can’t get well.

My lungs are almost gone.

And I—don’t want to.

I’m so tired, Valancy.

Only dying can rest me.

But it’s lovely to have you here—you’ll never know how much it means to me.

But Valancy—you work too hard.

You don’t need to—Father only wants his meals cooked.

I don’t think you are strong yourself.

You turn so pale sometimes.

And those drops you take.

_Are_ you well, dear?”  

“I’m all right,” said Valancy lightly.

She would not have Cissy worried.

“And I’m not working hard.

I’m glad to have some work to do—something that really wants to be done.”  

“Then”—Cissy slipped her hand wistfully into Valancy’s—“don’t let’s talk any more about my being sick.

Let’s just forget it.

Let’s pretend I’m a little girl again—and you have come here to play with me.

I used to wish that long ago—wish that you could come.

I knew you couldn’t, of course.

But how I did wish it!

You always seemed so different from the other girls—so kind and sweet—and as if you had something in yourself nobody knew about—some dear, pretty secret.

_

Had_ you, Valancy?”  

“I had my Blue Castle,” said Valancy, laughing a little.

She was pleased that Cissy had thought of her like this.

She had never suspected  [suspected - подозреваемый] that anybody liked or admired or wondered about her.

She told Cissy all about her Blue Castle.

She had never told any one about it before.  

“Every one has a Blue Castle, I think,” said Cissy softly.

“Only every one has a different name for it.

_

I_ had mine—once.”  

She put her two thin little hands over her face.

She did not tell Valancy—then—who had destroyed her Blue Castle.

But Valancy knew that, whoever it was, it was not Barney Snaith.     

CHAPTER XVIII   Valancy was acquainted with Barney by now—well acquainted, it seemed, though she had spoken to him only a few times.

But then she had felt just as well acquainted with him the first time they had met.

She had been in the garden at twilight, hunting for a few stalks of white narcissus for Cissy’s room when she heard that terrible old Grey Slosson coming down through the woods from Mistawis—one could hear it miles away.

Valancy did not look up as it drew near, thumping over the rocks in that crazy lane. [lane - полоса] 

She had never looked up, though Barney had gone racketting past every evening since she had been at Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel’s.

This time he did not racket past.

The old Grey Slosson stopped with even more terrible noises than it made going.

Valancy was conscious that Barney had sprung from it and was leaning  [leaning - наклоняющийся] over the ramshackle gate.

Neither of his eyebrows  [eyebrows - брови] looked like the other.

He was thin—too thin—she wished she could feed him up a bit—she wished she could sew the buttons on his coat—and make him cut his hair—and shave every day.

There was _something_ in his face—one hardly knew what it was.

Tiredness? [Tiredness - Усталость] 

Sadness?

Disillusionment? [Disillusionment - Разочарование] 

He had dimples in his thin cheeks  [cheeks - щеки] when he smiled.

All these thoughts flashed  [flashed - вспыхнули] through Valancy’s mind in that one moment while his eyes looked into hers.  

“Good-evening, Miss Stirling.”  

Nothing could be more commonplace  [commonplace - банальность] and conventional. [conventional - условные] 

Any one might have said it.

But Barney Snaith had a way of saying things that gave them poignancy.

When he said good-evening you felt that it _was_ a good evening and that it was partly his doing that it was.

Also, you felt that some of the credit was yours.

Valancy felt all this vaguely, but she couldn’t imagine why she was trembling from head to foot—it _must_ be her heart.

If only he didn’t notice it!  

“I’m going over to the Port,” Barney was saying.

“Can I acquire merit  [merit - заслуги] by getting or doing anything there for you or Cissy?”  “Will you get some salt codfish for us?” said Valancy.

It was the only thing she could think of.

Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel had expressed a desire that day for a dinner of boiled salt codfish.

When her knights came riding to the Blue Castle, Valancy had sent them on many a quest, [quest - квест]  but she had never asked any of them to get her salt codfish.  

“Certainly.

You’re sure there’s nothing else?

Lots of room in Lady Jane Grey Slosson.

And she always gets back _some_ time, does Lady Jane.”  

“I don’t think there’s anything more,” said Valancy.

She knew he would bring oranges for Cissy anyhow—he always did.  

Barney did not turn away at once.

He was silent for a little.

Then he said, slowly and whimsically:  “Miss Stirling, you’re a brick! [brick - кирпич] 

You’re a whole cartload of bricks. [bricks - кирпичи] 

To come here and look after Cissy—under the circumstances. [circumstances - обстоятельства] ”  

“There’s nothing so bricky about that,” said Valancy.

“I’d nothing else to do.

And—I like it here.

I don’t feel as if I’d done anything specially meritorious.

Mr. Gay is paying me fair wages. [wages - зарплата] 

I never earned any money before—and I like it.”

It seemed so easy to talk to Barney Snaith, someway—this terrible Barney Snaith of the lurid tales and mysterious past—as easy and natural as if talking to herself.  

“All the money in the world couldn’t buy what you’re doing for Cissy Gay,” said Barney.

“It’s splendid and fine of you.

And if there’s anything I can do to help you in any way, you have only to let me know.

If Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel ever tries to annoy you——”  “He doesn’t.

He’s lovely to me.

“So do I.

But there’s one stage of his drunkenness—perhaps you haven’t encountered  [encountered - столкнулась] it yet—when he sings ribald songs——”  “Oh, yes.

He came home last night like that.

Cissy and I just went to our room and shut ourselves in where we couldn’t hear him.

He apologised this morning.

I’m not afraid of any of Roaring  [Roaring - ревущая] Abel’s stages.”  

“Well, I’m sure he’ll be decent  [decent - приличная] to you, apart from his inebriated yowls,” said Barney.

“And I’ve told him he’s got to stop damning things when you’re around.”  

“Why?” asked Valancy slily, with one of her odd, [odd - нечетная]  slanted glances and a sudden flake of pink on each cheek, [cheek - щека]  born of the thought that Barney Snaith had actually done so much for _her_.

“I often feel like damning things myself.”  

For a moment Barney stared.

Was this elfin girl the little, old-maidish creature who had stood there two minutes ago?

Surely there was magic and devilry going on in that shabby, [shabby - потрепанная]  weedy old garden.  

Then he laughed.  

“It will be a relief  [relief - облегчение] to have some one to do it for you, then.

So you don’t want anything but salt codfish?”  

“Not tonight.

But I dare  [dare - смелость] say I’ll have some errands for you very often when you go to Port Lawrence.

I can’t trust Mr. Gay to remember to bring all the things I want.”  

Barney had gone away, then, in his Lady Jane, and Valancy stood in the garden for a long time.  

Since then he had called several times, walking down through the barrens, whistling.

How that whistle of his echoed through the spruces on those June twilights!

Valancy caught herself listening for it every evening—rebuked herself—then let herself go.

Why shouldn’t she listen for it?  

He always brought Cissy fruit and flowers.

Once he brought Valancy a box of candy—the first box of candy she had ever been given.

It seemed sacrilege  [sacrilege - кощунство] to eat it.  

She found herself thinking of him in season and out of season.

She wanted to know if he ever thought about her when she wasn’t before his eyes, and, if so, what.

She wanted to see that mysterious house of his back on the Mistawis island.

Cissy had never seen it.

Cissy, though she talked freely  [freely - свободно] of Barney and had known him for five years, really knew little more of him than Valancy herself.  

“But he isn’t bad,” said Cissy.

“Nobody need  [need - потребность] ever tell me he is.

He _can’t_ have done a thing to be ashamed of.”  

“Then why does he live as he does?” asked Valancy—to hear somebody defend him.  

“I don’t know.

He’s a mystery.

And of course there’s something behind it, but I _know_

it isn’t disgrace. [disgrace - позор] 

Barney Snaith simply couldn’t do anything disgraceful, Valancy.”  

Valancy was not so sure.

Barney must have done _something_—sometime.

He was a man of education and intelligence.

She had soon discovered that, in listening to his conversations and wrangles with Roaring Abel—who was surprisingly well read and could discuss any subject under the sun when sober. [sober - трезвый] 

Such a man wouldn’t bury himself for five years in Muskoka and live and look like a tramp  [tramp - бродяга] if there were not too good—or bad—a reason for it.

But it didn’t matter.

All that mattered was that she was sure now that he had never been Cissy Gay’s lover.

There was nothing like _that_ between them.

Though he was very fond  [fond - любящая] of Cissy and she of him, as any one could see.

But it was a fondness that didn’t worry Valancy.  

“You don’t know what Barney has been to me, these past two years,” Cissy had said simply.

“_

Barney told weird  [weird - странный] tales of his adventures with “shacks” on trains while hoboing it across the continent.

Valancy thought she ought to think his stealing rides quite dreadful, [dreadful - ужасный]  but didn’t.

The story of his working his way to England on a cattle- [cattle - скот] ship sounded more legitimate. [legitimate - законный] 

And his yarns of the Yukon enthralled her—especially the one of the night he was lost on the divide between Gold Run and Sulphur Valley.

He had spent two years out there.

Where in all this was there room for the penitentiary and the other things?  

If he were telling the truth.

But Valancy knew he was.  

“Found no gold,” he said.

“Came away poorer than when I went.

But such a place to live!

Those silences at the back of the north wind _got_ me.

I’ve never belonged to myself since.”  

Yet he was not a great talker.

He told a great deal in a few well-chosen words—how well-chosen Valancy did not realise.

And he had a knack of saying things without opening his mouth at all.  

“I like a man whose eyes say more than his lips,” thought Valancy.  

But then she liked everything about him—his tawny hair—his whimsical smiles—the little glints of fun in his eyes—his loyal  [loyal - верный] affection  [affection - привязанность] for that unspeakable Lady Jane—his habit of sitting with his hands in his pockets, his chin sunk on his breast, looking up from under his mismated eyebrows. [eyebrows - брови] 

She liked his nice voice which sounded as if it might become caressing or wooing  [wooing - ухаживание] with very little provocation.

She was at times almost afraid to let herself think these thoughts.

They were so vivid that she felt as if the others _must_

know what she was thinking.  

“I’ve been watching a woodpecker all day,” he said one evening on the shaky  [shaky - шаткий] old back verandah. [verandah - веранда] 

His account of the woodpecker’s doings was satisfying.

He had often some gay  [gay - веселая] or cunning little anecdote of the wood folk to tell them.

The barrens lay before her in a white moon splendour, where dozens of little rabbits frisked.

Barney, when he liked, could sit down on the edge of the barrens and lure  [lure - приманка] those rabbits right to him by some mysterious sorcery he possessed.

Valancy had once seen a squirrel leap  [leap - прыжок] from a scrub pine  [pine - сосна] to his shoulder and sit there chattering to him.

It reminded her of John Foster.  

It was one of the delights of Valancy’s new life that she could read John Foster’s books as often and as long as she liked.

She could read them in bed if she wanted to.

She read them all to Cissy, who loved them.

She also tried to read them to Abel and Barney, who did not love them.

Abel was bored and Barney politely refused to listen at all.  

“Piffle,” said Barney.     

CHAPTER XIX   Of course, the Stirlings had not left the poor maniac alone all this time or refrained from heroic efforts to rescue her perishing soul and reputation.

Uncle James, whose lawyer had helped him as little as his doctor, came one day and, finding Valancy alone in the kitchen, as he supposed, gave her a terrible talking- [talking - говорение] to—told her she was breaking her mother’s heart and disgracing her family.  

“But _why_?” said Valancy, not ceasing  [ceasing - прекращение] to scour her porridge pot decently.

“I’m doing honest work for honest pay.

What is there in that that is disgraceful?”  “Don’t quibble, Valancy,” said Uncle James solemnly.

“This is no fit place for you to be, and you know it.

Why, I’m told that jail-bird, Snaith, is hanging around here every evening.”  

“Not _every_ evening,” said Valancy reflectively.

“No, not quite every evening.”  

“It’s—it’s insufferable!” said Uncle James violently.

“Valancy, you _must_ come home.

We won’t judge your harshly.

I assure  [assure - уверить] you we won’t.

We will overlook  [overlook - пропустить] all this.”  

“Thank you,” said Valancy.  

“Have you no sense of shame?” demanded Uncle James.  

“Oh, yes.

But the things _I_ am ashamed of are not the things _you_ are ashamed of.”

Valancy proceeded  [proceeded - прошел] to rinse her dishcloth meticulously.  

Still was Uncle James patient.

He gripped  [gripped - захватил] the sides of his chair and ground  [ground - землю] his teeth.  

“We know your mind isn’t just right.

We’ll make allowances. [allowances - пособия] 

But you _must_ come home.

You shall not stay here with that drunken, [drunken - пьяный]  blasphemous  [blasphemous - кощунственный] old scoundrel——”  “Were you by any chance referring to _me_, _Mister_ Stirling?” demanded Roaring Abel, suddenly appearing in the doorway  [doorway - проем] of the back verandah  [verandah - веранда] where he had been smoking a peaceful pipe and listening to “old Jim Stirling’s” tirade with huge enjoyment!

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel crossed the kitchen at a bound, [bound - связанный]  caught him by his collar and his trousers, and hurled him through the doorway  [doorway - дверной проем] and over the garden paling with as little apparent effort as he might have employed  [employed - занятый] in whisking a troublesome  [troublesome - проблемный] kitten out of the way.  

“The next time you come back here,” he bellowed, [bellowed - ревел]  “I’ll throw you through the window—and all the better if the window is shut!

Coming here, thinking yourself God to put the world to rights!”  

Valancy candidly  [candidly - откровенно] and unashamedly  [unashamedly - нагло] owned to herself that she had seen few more satisfying sights than Uncle James’ coat-tails  [tails - хвосты] flying out into the asparagus bed.

She had once been afraid of this man’s judgment. [judgment - суд] 

Now she saw clearly that he was nothing but a rather stupid little village tin-god. [god - бог]   

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel turned with his great broad laugh.  

“He’ll think of that for years when he wakes up in the night.

The Almighty made a mistake in making so many Stirlings.

But since they are made, we’ve got to reckon  [reckon - считаться] with them.

Too many to kill out.

But if they come here bothering you I’ll shoo ’em off before a cat could lick  [lick - лизать] its ear.”  

The next time they sent Dr. Stalling.

Surely Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel would not throw him into asparagus beds.

He, Dr. Stalling, had never been able to understand her.

Therefore, beyond doubt, she was queer. [queer - странный] 

She was only just a little queerer than usual now.

And Dr. Stalling had his own reasons for disliking Roaring Abel.

When Dr. Stalling had first come to Deerwood he had had a liking  [liking - нравящийся] for long hikes around Mistawis and Muskoka.

On one of these occasions he had got lost and after much wandering had fallen in with Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel with his gun over his shoulder.  

Dr. Stalling had contrived to ask his question in about the most idiotic manner possible.

He said, “Can you tell me where I’m going?”  

“How the devil  [devil - дьявол] should I know where you’re going, gosling?” retorted Abel contemptuously.  

Dr. Stalling was so enraged that he could not speak for a moment or two and in that moment Abel had disappeared in the woods.

Dr. Stalling had eventually found his way home, but he had never hankered to encounter  [encounter - встреча] Abel Gay again.  

Nevertheless he came now to do his duty.

Valancy greeted him with a sinking heart.

She had to own to herself that she was terribly  [terribly - ужасно] afraid of Dr. Stalling still.

She had a miserable  [miserable - жалкий] conviction  [conviction - убеждение] that if he shook his long, bony  [bony - костяной] finger at her and told her to go home, she dared not disobey.  

“Mr. Gay,” said Dr. Stalling politely and condescendingly, “may I see Miss Stirling alone for a few minutes?”  

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel was a little drunk—just drunk enough to be excessively polite and very cunning.

He had been on the point of going away when Dr. Stalling arrived, but now he sat down in a corner of the parlour  [parlour - гостиная] and folded his arms.  

“No, no, mister,” he said solemnly.

“That wouldn’t do—wouldn’t do at all.

I’ve got the reputation of my household to keep up.

I’ve got to chaperone this young lady.

Can’t have any sparkin’ going on here behind my back.”  

Outraged Dr. Stalling looked so terrible that Valancy wondered how Abel could endure  [endure - терпеть] his aspect.

But Abel was not worried at all.  

“D’ye know anything about it, anyway?”

he asked genially.  

“About _what_?”  “Sparking,” said Abel coolly.  

Poor Dr. Stalling, who had never married because he believed in a celibate clergy, would not notice this ribald remark. [remark - замечание] 

He turned his back on Abel and addressed himself to Valancy.  

“Miss Stirling, I am here in response to your mother’s wishes.

She begged me to come.

I am charged with some messages from her.

Will you”—he wagged his forefinger—“will you hear them?”  

“Yes,” said Valancy faintly, [faintly - слабо]  eyeing the forefinger.

It had a hypnotic effect on her.  

“The first is this.

Back of her terror  [terror - террор] Valancy smiled in secret.

Uncle James must indeed regard the matter as desperate when he would loosen his purse-strings like that.

At any rate, her clan  [clan - клан] no longer despised  [despised - презираемый] her or ignored her.

She had become important to them.  

“That’s _my_ business, Mister,” said Abel.

“Miss Stirling can go if she pleases, or stay if she pleases.

I made a fair bargain  [bargain - сделка] with her, and she’s free to conclude it when she likes.

She gives me meals that stick to my ribs. [ribs - ребра] 

She don’t forget to put salt in the porridge.

She never slams  [slams - хлопает] doors, and when she has nothing to say she don’t talk.

That’s uncanny in a woman, you know, Mister.

I’m satisfied.

If she isn’t, she’s free to go.

But no woman comes here in Jim Stirling’s pay.

If any one does”—Abel’s voice was uncannily bland and polite—“I’ll spatter the road with her brains.

Tell him that with A. Gay’s compliments.”  

“Dr. Stalling, a nurse is not what Cissy needs,” said Valancy earnestly.

“She isn’t so ill as that, yet.

What she wants is companionship— [companionship - товарищество] somebody she knows and likes just to live with her.

You can understand that, I’m sure.”  

“I understand that your motive  [motive - мотив] is quite—ahem—commendable.”

Dr. Stalling felt that he was very broad-minded  [minded - мыслящий] indeed—especially as in his secret soul he did not believe Valancy’s motive  [motive - мотив] _was_ commendable.

He hadn’t the least idea what she was up to, but he was sure her motive  [motive - мотив] was not commendable.

When he could not understand a thing he straightway condemned  [condemned - осужденный] it.

Simplicity  [Simplicity - простота] itself!

“But your first duty is to your mother.

_

She_ needs you.

She implores you to come home—she will forgive everything if you will only come home.”  

“That’s a pretty little thought,” remarked Abel meditatively, as he ground  [ground - земля] some tobacco  [tobacco - табак] up in his hand.  

Dr. Stalling ignored him.  

“She entreats, but I, Miss Stirling,”—Dr.

Get your hat and coat and come _now_.”  

Dr. Stalling shook his finger at Valancy.

Before that pitiless finger she drooped and wilted visibly. [visibly - зримо]   

“She’s giving in,” thought Roaring Abel.

“She’ll go with him.

Beats  [Beats - Удары] all, the power these preacher fellows have over women.”  

Valancy _was_ on the point of obeying  [obeying - повинуясь] Dr. Stalling.

She must go home with him—and give up.

She would lapse  [lapse - падению] back to Doss Stirling again and for her few remaining days or weeks be the cowed, futile creature she had always been.

It was her fate— [fate - судьбе] typified by that relentless, [relentless - неустанно]  uplifted forefinger.

She could no more escape from it than Roaring  [Roaring - Рев] Abel from his predestination.

She eyed it as the fascinated  [fascinated - очарованный] bird eyes the snake.

Another moment—  “_Fear is the original sin_ [sin - грех] ,” suddenly said a still, small voice away back—back—back of Valancy’s consciousness. [consciousness - сознание] 

“_Almost all the evil  [evil - зло] in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of something_.”  

Valancy stood up.

She was still in the clutches  [clutches - хватки] of fear, but her soul was her own again.

She would not be false to that inner voice.  

“Dr. Stalling,” she said slowly, “I do not at present owe _any_ duty to my mother.

She is quite well; she has all the assistance  [assistance - помощь] and companionship  [companionship - товарищество] she requires; she does not need me at all.

I _am_ needed here.

I am going to stay here.”  

Do you remember your childhood days——”  “Perfectly.

And hate them.”  

“Do you realise what people will say?

What they _are_ saying?”  

“I can imagine it,” said Valancy, with a shrug of her shoulders.

She was suddenly free of fear again.

“I haven’t listened to the gossip of Deerwood teaparties and sewing  [sewing - шитье] circles twenty years for nothing.

But, Dr. Stalling, it doesn’t matter in the least to me what they say—not in the least.”  

Dr. Stalling went away then.

A girl who cared nothing for public opinion!

Over whom sacred  [sacred - священное] family ties had no restraining influence!

Who hated her childhood memories!  

Then Cousin Georgiana came—on her own initiative, [initiative - инициатива]  for nobody would have thought it worth while to send her.

She found Valancy alone, weeding the little vegetable garden she had planted, and she made all the platitudinous pleas  [pleas - просьбы] she could think of.

Valancy heard her patiently. [patiently - терпеливо] 

Cousin Georgiana wasn’t such a bad old soul.

Then she said:  “And now that you have got all that out of your system, Cousin Georgiana, can you tell me how to make creamed codfish so that it will not be as thick as porridge and as salt as the Dead Sea?”  *

* *

*

* * *  “We’ll just have to _wait_,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“After all, Cissy Gay can’t live long.

Dr. Marsh tells me she may drop off any day.”  

Mrs. Frederick wept.

It would really have been so much easier to bear if Valancy had died.

She could have worn mourning then.     

CHAPTER XX   When Abel Gay paid Valancy her first month’s wages— [wages - заработная плата] which he did promptly, [promptly - незамедлительно]  in bills reeking with the odour of tobacco  [tobacco - табак] and whiskey— [whiskey - виски] Valancy went into Deerwood and spent every cent of it.

She got a pretty green crêpe  [crêpe - креп] dress with a girdle of crimson beads, at a bargain  [bargain - сделка] sale, a pair of silk stockings, to match, and a little crinkled green hat with a crimson rose in it.

She even bought a foolish little beribboned and belaced nightgown.  

She passed the house on Elm Street twice—Valancy never even thought about it as “home”—but saw no one.

No doubt her mother was sitting in the room this lovely June evening playing solitaire—and cheating.

Valancy knew that Mrs. Frederick always cheated. [cheated - обманул] 

She never lost a game.

Most of the people Valancy met looked at her seriously and passed her with a cool nod.

Nobody stopped to speak to her.  

Valancy put on her green dress when she got home.

Then she took it off again.

She felt so miserably  [miserably - жалко] undressed in its low neck and short sleeves.

And that low, crimson girdle around the hips  [hips - бедра] seemed positively indecent.

She hung it up in the closet, feeling flatly that she had wasted her money.

She would never have the courage to wear that dress.

John Foster’s arraignment of fear had no power to stiffen  [stiffen - напрягся] her against this.

In this one thing habit and custom were still all-powerful.

She wished she could have left it on.

But there were some things John Foster did not know.  

Every Sunday evening Valancy went to the little Free Methodist church in a valley on the edge of “up back”—a spireless little grey building among the pines, [pines - сосны]  with a few sunken graves and mossy gravestones  [gravestones - надгробия] in the small, paling-encircled, grass-grown square beside it.

She liked the minister  [minister - министр] who preached  [preached - проповедовал] there.

He was so simple and sincere. [sincere - искренний] 

An old man, who lived in Port Lawrence and came out by the lake in a little disappearing propeller boat to give a free service to the people of the small, stony farms back of the hills, who would otherwise never have heard any gospel message.

She liked the simple service and the fervent singing.

She liked to sit by the open window and look out into the pine woods.

The congregation  [congregation - собрание] was always small.

The Free Methodists were few in number, poor and generally illiterate.

But Valancy loved those Sunday evenings.

For the first time in her life she liked going to church.

The rumour  [rumour - слух] reached Deerwood that she had “turned Free Methodist” and sent Mrs. Frederick to bed for a day.

But Valancy had not turned anything.

She went to the church because she liked it and because in some inexplicable  [inexplicable - необъяснимый] way it did her good.

Old Mr. Towers believed exactly what he preached  [preached - проповедовал] and somehow it made a tremendous  [tremendous - огромный] difference.  

Oddly  [Oddly - странно] enough, Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel disapproved  [disapproved - неодобренный] of her going to the hill church as strongly as Mrs. Frederick herself could have done.

He had “no use for Free Methodists.

He was a Presbyterian.”

But Valancy went in spite  [spite - злоба] of him.  

“We’ll hear something worse than _that_ about her soon,” Uncle Benjamin predicted gloomily.  

They did.  

Valancy could not quite explain, even to herself, just why she wanted to go to that party.

It was a dance “up back” at Chidley Corners; and dances at Chidley Corners were not, as a rule, the sort of assemblies  [assemblies - собрания] where well-brought-up young ladies were found.

But the idea of going had never occurred to her until Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel himself broached it at supper.  

“You come with me to the dance,” he ordered.

“It’ll do you good—put some colour in your face.

You look peaked—you want something to liven you up.”  

Valancy found herself suddenly wanting to go.

She knew nothing at all of what dances at Chidley Corners were apt  [apt - меткий] to be like.

Her idea of dances had been fashioned on the correct affairs that went by that name in Deerwood and Port Lawrence.

Of course she knew the Corners’ dance wouldn’t be just like them.

Much more informal, [informal - неформальный]  of course.

But so much the more interesting.

Why shouldn’t she go?

Cissy was in a week of apparent health and improvement.

She wouldn’t mind staying alone in the least.

She entreated Valancy to go if she wanted to.

And Valancy _did_ want to go.  

She went to her room to dress.

A rage  [rage - ярость] against the snuff-brown silk seized  [seized - захваченный] her.

Wear that to a party!

Never.

She pulled her green crêpe  [crêpe - креп] from its hanger and put it on feverishly.

It was nonsense  [nonsense - бред] to feel so—so—naked— [naked - голый] just because her neck and arms were bare. [bare - голый] 

That was just her old maidishness.

She would not be ridden by it.

On went the dress—the slippers.  

It was the first time she had worn a pretty dress since the organdies of her early teens.

And _they_ had never made her look like this.  

If she only had a necklace or something.

She wouldn’t feel so bare  [bare - голый] then.

She ran down to the garden.

There were clovers there—great crimson things growing in the long grass.

Valancy gathered handfuls of them and strung them on a cord. [cord - шнур] 

Fastened above her neck they gave her the comfortable sensation  [sensation - сенсация] of a collar and were oddly  [oddly - странно] becoming.

Another circlet of them went round her hair, dressed in the low puffs that became her.

Excitement brought those faint pink stains  [stains - пятна] to her face.

She flung on her coat and pulled the little, twisty hat over her hair.  

“You look so nice and—and—different, dear,” said Cissy.

“Like a green moonbeam with a gleam  [gleam - блеск] of red in it, if there could be such a thing.”  

Valancy stooped to kiss her.  

“I don’t feel right about leaving you alone, Cissy.”  

“Oh, I’ll be all right.

I feel better tonight than I have for a long while.

I’ve been feeling badly to see you sticking here so closely on my account.

I hope you’ll have a nice time.

I never was at a party at the Corners, but I used to go sometimes, long ago, to dances up back.

We always had good times.

And you needn’t be afraid of Father being drunk tonight.

He never drinks when he engages to play for a party.

But—there may be—liquor.

What will you do if it gets rough?”  

“Nobody would molest me.”  

“Not seriously, I suppose.

Father would see to that.

But it _might_ be noisy and—and unpleasant.”  

“I won’t mind.

I’m only going as a looker-on.

I don’t expect to dance.

I just want to _see_

what a party up back is like.

I’ve never seen anything except decorous Deerwood.”  

Cissy smiled rather dubiously.

She knew much better than Valancy what a party “up back” might be like if there should be liquor.

But again there mightn’t be.  

“I hope you’ll enjoy it, dear,” she repeated.  

Valancy enjoyed the drive there.

It wound  [wound - рана] through beautiful, purring pines  [pines - сосны] that were ranks of enchantment in the June sunset, and over the curious  [curious - любопытный] jade-green rivers of Muskoka, fringed by aspens that were always quivering with some supernal joy.  

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel was excellent company, too.

He knew all the stories and legends  [legends - легенды] of the wild, beautiful “up back,” and he told them to Valancy as they drove along.

Valancy had several fits  [fits - припадки] of inward laughter over what Uncle Benjamin and Aunt Wellington, _et al._, would feel and think and say if they saw her driving with Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel in that terrible buggy  [buggy - багги] to a dance at Chidley Corners.  

At first the dance was quiet enough, and Valancy was amused  [amused - позабавленный] and entertained.

She even danced twice herself, with a couple of nice “up back” boys who danced beautifully and told her she did, too.  

Another compliment came her way—not a very subtle  [subtle - тонкий] one, perhaps, but Valancy had had too few compliments in her life to be over-nice on that point.

She overheard  [overheard - подслушанный] two of the “up back” young men talking about her in the dark “lean-to” behind her.  

“Know who that girl in green is?”  “Nope.

Guess she’s from out front.

The Port, maybe.

Got a stylish look to her.”  

“No beaut but cute- [cute - милый] looking, I’ll say.

‘Jever see such eyes?”  

The big room was decorated  [decorated - украшенный] with pine  [pine - сосна] and fir boughs, and lighted by Chinese lanterns.

The “up back” girls were pretty and prettily dressed.

Valancy thought it the nicest party she had ever attended.  

By eleven o’clock she had changed her mind.

A new crowd had arrived—a crowd unmistakably  [unmistakably - безошибочно] drunk.

Whiskey  [Whiskey - Виски] began to circulate  [circulate - циркулировать] freely. [freely - свободно] 

Very soon almost all the men were partly drunk.

Those in the porch  [porch - крыльцо] and outside around the door began howling “come-all-ye’s” and continued to howl them.

The room grew noisy and reeking.

Quarrels  [Quarrels - Ссоры] started up here and there.

Bad language and obscene songs were heard.

The girls, swung  [swung - замахнулись] rudely in the dances, became dishevelled and tawdry.

Valancy, alone in her corner, was feeling disgusted  [disgusted - отвращение] and repentant.

Why had she ever come to such a place?

Freedom and independence  [independence - независимость] were all very well, but one should not be a little fool. [fool - дурачок] 

She might have known what it would be like—she might have taken warning from Cissy’s guarded  [guarded - стерег] sentences.

Her head was aching— [aching - болит] she was sick of the whole thing.

But what could she do?

She must stay to the end.

Abel could not leave till then.

And that would probably be not till three or four in the morning.  

The new influx of boys had left the girls far in the minority and partners were scarce. [scarce - скудно] 

Valancy was pestered with invitations to dance.

She refused them all shortly, [shortly - коротко]  and some of her refusals  [refusals - отказы] were not well taken.

Across the room she saw a group of the strangers talking together and glancing meaningly at her.

What were they plotting?  

It was at this moment that she saw Barney Snaith looking in over the heads of the crowd at the doorway. [doorway - дверной проем] 

Valancy had two distinct  [distinct - отчетливые] convictions— [convictions - убеждения] one was that she was quite safe now; the other was that _this_ was why she had wanted to come to the dance.

It had been such an absurd  [absurd - абсурдные] hope that she had not recognised it before, but now she knew she had come because of the possibility that Barney might be there, too.

She thought that perhaps she ought to be ashamed for this, but she wasn’t.

After her feeling of relief  [relief - облегчение] her next feeling was one of annoyance with Barney for coming there unshaved.

Surely he might have enough self-respect to groom himself up decently when he went to a party.

There he was, bareheaded, bristly-chinned, in his old trousers and his blue homespun shirt.

Not even a coat.

Valancy could have shaken him in her anger.

No wonder people believed everything bad of him.  

But she was not afraid any longer.

One of the whispering group left his comrades and came across the room to her, through the whirling couples that now filled it uncomfortably. [uncomfortably - неудобно] 

He was a tall, broad-shouldered fellow, not ill-dressed or ill-looking but unmistakably  [unmistakably - безошибочно] half drunk.

He asked Valancy to dance.

Valancy declined  [declined - отказался] civilly.

His face turned livid.

He threw his arm about her and pulled her to him.

His hot, whiskied breath burned her face.  

“We won’t have fine-lady airs here, my girl.

If you ain’t too good to come here you ain’t too good to dance with us.

Me and my pals have been watching you.

You’ve got to give us each a turn and a kiss to boot.”  

Valancy tried desperately  [desperately - отчаянно] and vainly to free  [free - свободный] herself.

She was being dragged out into the maze of shouting, stamping, yelling  [yelling - орущий] dancers.

The next moment the man who held her went staggering  [staggering - пошатываясь] across the room from a neatly  [neatly - аккуратно] planted blow  [blow - удар] on the jaw, [jaw - челюсть]  knocking down whirling couples as he went.

Valancy felt her arm grasped.  

“This way—quick,” said Barney Snaith.

Suppose she did!

What a scandal  [scandal - скандал] it would make for her poor people.

For the first time Valancy felt a little sorry for them.

Also, she felt glad that she had escaped from that horrible row.

Also, glad that she was holding tight  [tight - туго] to Barney’s hand.

Her feelings were badly mixed and she had never had so many in such a brief time in her life.  

They finally reached a quiet corner in the pine woods.

The pursuit  [pursuit - преследование] had taken a different direction and the whoops and yells  [yells - вопит] behind them were growing faint.

Valancy, out of breath, with a crazily  [crazily - безумно] beating heart, collapsed  [collapsed - рухнул] on the trunk  [trunk - ствол] of a fallen pine. [pine - сосна]   

“Thanks,” she gasped.  

“What a goose  [goose - гусь] you were to come to such a place!” said Barney.  

“I—didn’t—know—it—would—be like this,” protested  [protested - протестовал] Valancy.  

“You _should_ have known.

Chidley Corners!”  

“It—was—just—a name—to me.”  

Valancy knew Barney could not realise how ignorant  [ignorant - невежественный] she was of the regions “up back.”

She had lived in Deerwood all her life and of course he supposed she knew.

He didn’t know how she had been brought up.

There was no use trying to explain.  

“When I drifted  [drifted - дрейфовал] in at Abel’s this evening and Cissy told me you’d come here I was amazed.

And downright scared.

Cissy told me she was worried about you but hadn’t liked to say anything to dissuade you for fear you’d think she was thinking selfishly about herself.

So I came on up here instead of going to Deerwood.”  

Valancy felt a sudden delightful glow  [glow - светиться] irradiating soul and body under the dark pines. [pines - сосны] 

So he had actually come up to look after her.  

“As soon as they stop hunting for us we’ll sneak  [sneak - подкрасться] around to the Muskoka road.

I left Lady Jane down there.

I’ll take you home.

I suppose you’ve had enough of your party.”  

“Quite,” said Valancy meekly.

The first half of the way home neither of them said anything.

It would not have been much use.

Lady Jane made so much noise they could not have heard each other.

By Barney Snaith, reputed  [reputed - прославленный] jail-breaker, infidel, forger  [forger - фальсификатор] and defaulter.

Valancy’s lips twitched  [twitched - дергался] in the darkness  [darkness - мрак] as she thought of it.

But she _was_ ashamed.  

And yet she was enjoying herself—was full of a strange exultation—bumping over that rough road beside Barney Snaith.

The big trees shot by them.

The tall mulleins stood up along the road in stiff, [stiff - жесткий]  orderly ranks like companies of soldiers.

The thistles looked like drunken  [drunken - пьяный] fairies or tipsy elves as their car-lights passed over them.

This was the first time she had even been in a car.

After all, she liked it.

She was not in the least afraid, with Barney at the wheel.

Her spirits rose rapidly as they tore along.

She ceased  [ceased - прекратил] to feel ashamed.

She ceased  [ceased - прекратил] to feel anything except that she was part of a comet rushing gloriously through the night of space.  

All at once, just where the pine woods frayed out to the scrub barrens, Lady Jane became quiet—too quiet.

Lady Jane slowed down quietly—and stopped.  

Barney uttered  [uttered - произнес] an aghast exclamation. [exclamation - восклицание] 

Got out.

Investigated. [Investigated - расследовал] 

Came apologetically  [apologetically - извиняясь] back.  

“I’m a doddering idiot. [idiot - идиот] 

Out of gas.

I knew I was short when I left home, but I meant to fill up in Deerwood.

Then I forgot all about it in my hurry to get to the Corners.”  

“What can we do?” asked Valancy coolly.  

“I don’t know.

There’s no gas nearer than Deerwood, nine miles away.

And I don’t dare  [dare - смел] leave you here alone.

There were boys there from the Port.

As far as I can see, the best thing to do is for us just to sit patiently  [patiently - терпеливо] here until some car comes along and lends us enough gas to get to Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel’s with.”  

“Well, what’s the matter with that?” said Valancy.  

“We may have to sit here all night,” said Barney.  

“I don’t mind,” said Valancy.  

Barney gave a short laugh.

“If you don’t, I needn’t.

I haven’t any reputation to lose.”  

“Nor I,” said Valancy comfortably. [comfortably - удобно]      

CHAPTER XXI   

“We’ll just sit here,” said Barney, “and if we think of anything worth while saying we’ll say it.

Otherwise, not.

Don’t imagine you’re bound  [bound - связанный] to talk to me.”  

“John Foster says,” quoted  [quoted - цитируемый] Valancy, “‘If you can sit in silence with a person for half an hour and yet be entirely comfortable, you and that person can be friends.

If you cannot, friends you’ll never be and you need not waste time in trying.’”  “Evidently  [Evidently - Очевидно] John Foster says a sensible  [sensible - разумный] thing once in a while,” conceded  [conceded - уступивший] Barney.  

They sat in silence for a long while.

Little rabbits hopped across the road.

Once or twice an owl  [owl - сова] laughed out delightfully.

The road beyond them was fringed with the woven shadow lace  [lace - кружево] of trees.

Away off to the southwest the sky was full of silvery little cirrus clouds above the spot where Barney’s island must be.  

Valancy was perfectly happy.

Some things dawn on you slowly.

Some things come by lightning flashes. [flashes - вспышки] 

Valancy had had a lightning flash. [flash - вспышка]   

She knew quite well now that she loved Barney.

Yesterday she had been all her own.

Now she was this man’s.

Yet he had done nothing—said nothing.

He had not even looked at her as a woman.

But that didn’t matter.

Nor did it matter what he was or what he had done.

She loved him without any reservations.

Everything in her went out wholly  [wholly - полностью] to him.

She had no wish to stifle or disown her love.

She seemed to be his so absolutely that thought apart from him—thought in which he did not predominate—was an impossibility. [impossibility - невозможность]   

She had realised, quite simply and fully, that she loved him, in the moment when he was leaning  [leaning - опираясь] on the car door, explaining that Lady Jane had no gas.

Love had cast  [cast - литье] out her last fear.  

Love!

What a searing, torturing, [torturing - мучительное]  intolerably sweet thing it was—this possession of body, soul and mind!

With something at its core  [core - ядро] as fine and remote and purely  [purely - чисто] spiritual as the tiny blue spark  [spark - искра] in the heart of the unbreakable diamond.

No dream had ever been like this.

She was no longer solitary.

She was one of a vast sisterhood—all the women who had ever loved in the world.  

Barney need  [need - нужно] never know it—though she would not in the least have minded his knowing.

But _she_ knew it and it made a tremendous  [tremendous - потрясающе] difference to her.

Just to love!

She did not ask to be loved.

It was rapture enough just to sit there beside him in silence, alone in the summer night in the white splendour of moonshine, with the wind blowing down on them out of the pine woods.

She had always envied  [envied - завидно] the wind.

So free.

Blowing where it listed. [listed - перечислено] 

Through the hills.

Over the lakes.

What a tang, what a zip  [zip - zip] it had!

What a magic of adventure!

Valancy felt as if she had exchanged her shop-worn soul for a fresh one, fire-new from the workshop  [workshop - мастерская] of the gods. [gods - боги] 

As far back as she could look, life had been dull— [dull - уныло] colourless— [colourless - бесцветный] savourless.

Now she had come to a little patch  [patch - патч] of violets, purple and fragrant—hers for the plucking.

No matter who or what had been in Barney’s past—no matter who or what might be in his future—no one else could ever have this perfect hour.

“Ever dream of ballooning?” said Barney suddenly.  

“No,” said Valancy.  

“I do—often.

Dream of sailing  [sailing - парусный спорт] through the clouds—seeing the glories  [glories - слава] of sunset—spending hours in the midst  [midst - посреди] of a terrific  [terrific - потрясающий] storm with lightning playing above and below you—skimming  [skimming - снятие] above a silver cloud floor under a full moon—wonderful!”  

“It does sound so,” said Valancy.

“I’ve stayed on earth in my dreams.”  

She told him about her Blue Castle.

It was so easy to tell Barney things.

One felt he understood everything—even the things you didn’t tell him.

And then she told him a little of her existence before she came to Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel’s.

She wanted him to see why she had gone to the dance “up back.”  

“You see—I’ve never had any real life,” she said.

“I’ve just—breathed.

Every door has always been shut to me.”  

“But you’re still young,” said Barney.  

“Oh, I know.

Yes, I’m ‘still young’—but

that’s so different from _young_,” said Valancy bitterly. [bitterly - горько] 

For a moment she was tempted  [tempted - соблазненный] to tell Barney why her years had nothing to do with her future; but she did not.

She was not going to think of death tonight.  

“Though I never was really young,” she went on—“until tonight,” she added in her heart.

“I never had a life like other girls.

You couldn’t understand.

Why,”—she had a desperate desire that Barney should know the worst about her—“I didn’t even love my mother.

Isn’t it awful that I don’t love my mother?”  

“Rather awful—for her,” said Barney drily.  

“Oh, she didn’t know it.

She took my love for granted.

And I wasn’t any use or comfort to her or anybody.

I was just a—a—vegetable.

And I got tired of it.

That’s why I came to keep house for Mr. Gay and look after Cissy.”  

“And I suppose your people thought you’d gone mad.”  

“They did—and do—literally, [literally - буквально] ” said Valancy.

“But it’s a comfort to them.

They’d rather believe me mad than bad.

There’s no other alternative.

But I’ve been _living_ since I came to Mr. Gay’s.

It’s been a delightful experience.

I suppose I’ll pay for it when I have to go back—but I’ll have _had_ it.”  

“That’s true,” said Barney.

“If you buy your experience it’s your own.

So it’s no matter how much you pay for it.

Somebody else’s experience can never be yours.

Well, it’s a funny old world.”  

“Do you think it really is old?” asked Valancy dreamily. [dreamily - мечтательно] 

“I never believe _that_ in June.

It seems so young tonight—somehow.

In that quivering moonlight— [moonlight - лунный свет] like a young, white girl—waiting.”  

“Moonlight  [moonlight - лунный свет] here on the verge  [verge - грань] of up back is different from moonlight anywhere else,” agreed Barney.

“It always makes me feel so clean, somehow—body and soul.

And of course the age of gold always comes back in spring.”  

It was ten o’clock now.

A dragon of black cloud ate up the moon.

The spring air grew chill— [chill - холод] Valancy shivered.

“No.

I’m not going to have you catching cold on my hands.”  

“Oh, I won’t catch cold.

I haven’t had a cold since I came to Mr. Gay’s—though I’ve done the foolishest things.

It’s funny, too—I used to have them all the time.

I feel so selfish taking your coat.”  

“You’ve sneezed  [sneezed - чихнул] three times.

No use winding  [winding - обмотка] up your ‘experience’ up back with grippe or pneumonia. [pneumonia - пневмония] ”  

He pulled it up tight  [tight - туго] about her throat  [throat - горло] and buttoned it on her.

Valancy submitted  [submitted - подчиненный] with secret delight.

How nice it was to have some one look after you so!

She snuggled down into the tobaccoey folds and wished the night could last forever.  

Ten minutes later a car swooped down on them from “up back.”

Barney sprang from Lady Jane and waved his hand.

The car came to a stop beside them.

Valancy saw Uncle Wellington and Olive gazing at her in horror from it.  

So Uncle Wellington had got a car!

And he must have been spending the evening up at Mistawis with Cousin Herbert.

Valancy almost laughed aloud at the expression on his face as he recognised her.

The pompous, bewhiskered old humbug!  

“Can you let me have enough gas to take me to Deerwood?”

Barney was asking politely.

But Uncle Wellington was not attending to him.  

“Valancy, how came you _here_!”

he said sternly.  

“By chance or God’s grace, [grace - грация] ” said Valancy.  

“With this jail-bird—at ten o’clock at night!” said Uncle Wellington.  

Valancy turned to Barney.

The moon had escaped from its dragon and in its light her eyes were full of deviltry.  

“_Are_ you a jail-bird?”  “Does it matter?” said Barney, gleams  [gleams - блестки] of fun in _his_ eyes.  

“Not to me.

I only asked out of curiosity, [curiosity - любопытство] ” continued Valancy.  

“Then I won’t tell you.

I never satisfy curiosity. [curiosity - любопытство] ”

He turned to Uncle Wellington and his voice changed subtly. [subtly - тонко]   

“Mr. Stirling, I asked you if you could let me have some gas.

If you can, well and good.

If not, we are only delaying you unnecessarily.”  

Uncle Wellington was in a horrible dilemma. [dilemma - дилемма] 

To give gas to this shameless  [shameless - бесстыдство] pair!

But not to give it to them!

To go away and leave them there in the Mistawis woods—until daylight, likely.

It was better to give it to them and let them get out of sight before any one else saw them.  

“Got anything to get gas in?”

he grunted surlily.  

Barney produced a two-gallon  [gallon - галлон] measure from Lady Jane.

He agreed that her mind was deranged and was exceedingly anxious to find out whence the derangement had been inherited. [inherited - унаследованный] 

It was a serious thing to have in the family—a very serious thing.

One had to think of one’s—descendants.  

“She got it from the Wansbarras,” said Olive positively.

“There’s nothing like that in the Stirlings—nothing!”  

“I hope not—I certainly hope not,” Cecil had responded dubiously.

“But then—to go out as a servant— [servant - слуга] for that is what it practically  [practically - практически] amounts to.

Your cousin!”  

Poor Olive felt the implication. [implication - смысл] 

The Port Lawrence Prices were not accustomed  [accustomed - привычный] to ally themselves with families whose members “worked out.”  

Valancy could not resist temptation. [temptation - соблазн] 

She leaned  [leaned - наклоняющийся] forward.  

“Olive, does it hurt?”  

Olive bit—stiffly.  

“Does _what_ hurt?”  

“Looking like that.”  

For a moment Olive resolved she would take no further notice of Valancy.

Then duty came uppermost.

She must not miss the opportunity.  

“Doss,” she implored, leaning  [leaning - наклоняющийся] forward also, “won’t you come home—come home tonight?”  

Valancy yawned. [yawned - зевовший]   

“You sound like a revival  [revival - возрождение] meeting,” she said.

“You really do.”  

“If you will come back——”  “All will be forgiven.”  

“Yes,” said Olive eagerly. [eagerly - жадно] 

Wouldn’t it be splendid if _she_ could induce  [induce - вынуждающий] the prodigal daughter to return?

“We’ll never cast  [cast - бросать] it up to you.

Doss, there are nights when I cannot sleep for thinking of you.”  

“And me having the time of my life,” said Valancy, laughing.  

“Doss, I can’t believe you’re bad.

I’ve always said you couldn’t be bad——”  “I don’t believe I can be,” said Valancy.

“I’m afraid I’m hopelessly  [hopelessly - безнадежно] proper.

I’ve been sitting here for three hours with Barney Snaith and he hasn’t even tried to kiss me.

I wouldn’t have minded if he had, Olive.”  

Valancy was still leaning  [leaning - наклоняющийся] forward.

Her little hat with its crimson rose was tilted down over one eye.

Olive stared.

Olive drew back.

It was beneath  [beneath - ниже] her dignity  [dignity - достоинство] to say more.

After all, Valancy must be both mad _and_ bad.  

“Thanks—that’s enough,” said Barney behind the car.

“Much obliged, Mr. Stirling.

Two gallons— [gallons - галлоны] seventy cents.

Thank you.”  

Uncle Wellington climbed foolishly  [foolishly - глупо] and feebly into his car.

He wanted to give Snaith a piece of his mind, but dared  [dared - осмелился] not.

Who knew what the creature might do if provoked? [provoked - спровоцировал] 

No doubt he carried firearms. [firearms - огнестрельное оружие]   

Uncle Wellington looked indecisively at Valancy.

But Valancy had turned her back on him and was watching Barney pour the gas into Lady Jane’s maw.  

“Drive on,” said Olive decisively. [decisively - решительно] 

“There’s no use in waiting here.

Let me tell you what she said to me.”  

“The little hussy!

The shameless  [shameless - бесстыдно] little hussy!” said Uncle Wellington.     

CHAPTER XXII   

The next thing the Stirlings heard was that Valancy had been seen with Barney Snaith in a movie theatre in Port Lawrence and after it at supper in a Chinese restaurant there.

This was quite true—and no one was more surprised at it than Valancy herself.

Barney had come along in Lady Jane one dim  [dim - тускло] twilight and told Valancy unceremoniously if she wanted a drive to hop in.  

“I’m going to the Port.

Will you go there with me?”  

His eyes were teasing  [teasing - дразнить] and there was a bit of defiance in his voice.

Valancy, who did not conceal  [conceal - скрыть] from herself that she would have gone anywhere with him to any place, “hopped in” without more ado.

They tore into and through Deerwood.

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles, taking a little air on the verandah, [verandah - веранду]  saw them whirl by in a cloud of dust and sought comfort in each other’s eyes.

Valancy, who in some dim  [dim - тускло] pre-existence had been afraid of a car, was hatless and her hair was blowing wildly round her face.

She would certainly come down with bronchitis—and die at Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel’s.

“I will not believe,” said Cousin Stickles solemnly, “that our prayers will not yet be answered.”  

“Who—_who_ will protect that unfortunate  [unfortunate - несчастный] girl when I am gone?” moaned Mrs. Frederick.  

As for Valancy, she was wondering if it could really be only a few weeks since she had sat there with them on that verandah. [verandah - веранда] 

Hating the rubber-plant.

Pestered with teasing  [teasing - дразнящий] questions like black flies.

Always thinking of appearances.

Cowed because of Aunt Wellington’s teaspoons  [teaspoons - ложки] and Uncle Benjamin’s money.

Poverty-stricken.

Afraid of everybody.

Envying  [Envying - завидующий] Olive.

A slave to moth-eaten traditions.

Nothing to hope for or expect.  

And now every day was a gay  [gay - веселый] adventure.  

Lady Jane flew over the fifteen miles between Deerwood and the Port—through the Port.

The way Barney went past traffic policemen was not holy.

The lights were beginning to twinkle out like stars in the clear, lemon-hued twilight air.

This was the only time Valancy ever really liked the town, and she was crazy with the delight of speeding.

Was it possible she had ever been afraid of a car?

She was perfectly happy, riding beside Barney.

Not that she deluded herself into thinking it had any significance. [significance - значительность] 

She knew quite well that Barney had asked her to go on the impulse  [impulse - импульс]  [impulse - импульс] of the moment—an impulse born of a feeling of pity  [pity - жалость] for her and her starved  [starved - голодный] little dreams.

She was looking tired after a wakeful night with a heart attack, followed by a busy day.

She had so little fun.

He’d give her an outing  [outing - вылазка] for once.

Besides, Abel was in the kitchen, at the point of drunkenness where he was declaring he did not believe in God and beginning to sing ribald songs.

It was just as well she should be out of the way for a while.

Barney knew Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel’s repertoire. [repertoire - репертуар]   

They went to the movie—Valancy had never been to a movie.

Mrs. Frederick gave up going to church altogether. [altogether - совсем] 

She could not endure  [endure - терпеть] her friends’ pitying glances and questions.

But Cousin Stickles went every Sunday.

She said they had been given a cross to bear.     

CHAPTER XXIII   

On one of Cissy’s wakeful nights, she told Valancy her poor little story.

They were sitting by the open window.

Cissy could not get her breath lying down that night.

An inglorious gibbous moon was hanging over the wooded  [wooded - лесистой] hills and in its spectral light Cissy looked frail and lovely and incredibly young.

A child.

It did not seem possible that she could have lived through all the passion and pain and shame of her story.  

“He was stopping at the hotel across the lake.

He used to come over in his canoe  [canoe - каноэ] at night—we met in the pines  [pines - сосны] down the shore. [shore - берег] 

He was a young college student—his father was a rich man in Toronto.

Oh, Valancy, I didn’t mean to be bad—I didn’t, indeed.

But I loved him so—I love him yet—I’ll always love him.

And I—didn’t know—some things.

I didn’t—understand.

Then his father came and took him away.

And—after a little—I found out—oh, Valancy,—I was so frightened.

I didn’t know what to do.

I wrote him—and he came.

He—he said he would marry me, Valancy.”  

“And why—and why?——”  “Oh, Valancy, he didn’t love me any more.

I saw that at a glance.

He—he was just offering to marry me because he thought he ought to—because he was sorry for me.

He wasn’t bad—but he was so young—and what was I that he should keep on loving me?”  

“Never mind making excuses for him,” said Valancy a bit shortly. [shortly - ненадолго] 

“So you wouldn’t marry him?”  

“I couldn’t—not when he didn’t love me any more.

Somehow—I can’t explain—it seemed a worse thing to do than—the other.

He—he argued a little—but he went away.

Do you think I did right, Valancy?”  

“Yes, I do.

_

You_ did right.

But he——”  “Don’t blame him, dear.

Please don’t.

Let’s not talk about him at all.

There’s no need. [need - нуждаться] 

I wanted to tell you how it was—I didn’t want you to think me bad——”  “I never did think so.”  

“Yes, I felt that—whenever you came.

Oh, Valancy, what you’ve been to me!

I can never tell you—but God will bless  [bless - благословить] you for it.

I know He will—‘with what measure ye mete.’”  

Cissy sobbed  [sobbed - рыдать] for a few minutes in Valancy’s arms.

Then she wiped  [wiped - вытирать] her eyes.  

“Well, that’s almost all.

I came home.

I wasn’t really so very unhappy.

I suppose I should have been—but I wasn’t.

Father wasn’t hard on me.

And my baby was so sweet while he lived.

I was even happy—I loved him so much, the dear little thing.

He was so sweet, Valancy—with such lovely blue eyes—and little rings of pale gold hair like silk floss—and tiny dimpled hands.

I used to bite his satin-smooth little face all over—softly, so as not to hurt him, you know——”  “I know,” said Valancy, wincing.

“I know—a woman _always_ knows—and dreams——”  “And he was _all_ mine.

Nobody else had any claim on him.

When he died, oh, Valancy, I thought I must die too—I didn’t see how anybody could endure  [endure - терпеть] such anguish  [anguish - тоску] and live.

To see his dear little eyes and know he would never open them again—to miss his warm little body nestled against mine at night and think of him sleeping alone and cold, his wee face under the hard frozen earth.

It was so awful for the first year—after that it was a little easier, one didn’t keep thinking ‘this day last

year’—but I was so glad when I found out I was dying.”  

“‘Who could endure  [endure - терпеть] life if it were not for the hope of death?’” murmured Valancy softly—it was of course a quotation  [quotation - цитировать] from some book of John Foster’s.  

When Valancy saw the change that had come over Cissy’s face she wanted to telephone for the doctor.

But Cissy wouldn’t let her.  

“Valancy, why should you?

He can do nothing for me.

I’ve known for several days that—this—was near.

Let me die in peace, dear—just holding your hand.

Oh, I’m so glad you’re here.

Tell Father good-bye for me.

He’s always been as good to me as he knew how—and Barney.

Somehow, I think that Barney——”  But a spasm of coughing interrupted and exhausted  [exhausted - измученный] her.

She fell asleep when it was over, still holding to Valancy’s hand.

Valancy sat there in the silence.

She was not frightened—or even sorry.

At sunrise Cissy died.

She opened her eyes and looked past Valancy at something—something that made her smile suddenly and happily.

And, smiling, she died.  

Valancy crossed Cissy’s hands on her breast and went to the open window.

In the eastern sky, amid  [amid - среди] the fires of sunrise, an old moon was hanging—as slender and lovely as a new moon.

Valancy had never seen an old, old moon before.

She watched it pale and fade  [fade - увядший] until it paled and faded  [faded - увядший] out of sight in the living  [living - живой] rose of day.

A little pool in the barrens shone in the sunrise like a great golden  [golden - золотой] lily.  

But the world suddenly seemed a colder place to Valancy.

Again nobody needed her.

She was not in the least sorry Cecilia was dead.

She was only sorry for all her suffering  [suffering - страдающий] in life.

But nobody could ever hurt her again.

Valancy had always thought death dreadful. [dreadful - ужасный] 

But Cissy had died so quietly—so pleasantly.

And at the very last—something—had made up to her for everything.

She was lying there now, in her white sleep, looking like a child.

Beautiful!

All the lines of shame and pain gone.  

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel drove in, justifying  [justifying - оправдывающийся] his name.

Valancy went down and told him.

The shock sobered him at once.

He slumped down on the seat of his buggy, [buggy - глючный]  his great head hanging.  

“Cissy dead—Cissy dead,” he said vacantly.

“I didn’t think it would ‘a’ come so soon.

Dead.

She used to run down the lane  [lane - переулок] to meet me with a little white rose stuck in her hair.

Cissy used to be a pretty little girl.

And a good little girl.”  

“She has always been a good little girl,” said Valancy.     

CHAPTER XXIV   Valancy herself made Cissy ready for burial. [burial - похоронный] 

No hands but hers should touch that pitiful, wasted little body.

The old house was spotless on the day of the funeral. [funeral - похоронный] 

Barney Snaith was not there.

He had done all he could to help Valancy before it—he had shrouded the pale Cecilia in white roses  [roses - розы] from the garden—and then had gone back to his island.

But everybody else was there.

All Deerwood and “up back” came.

They forgave Cissy splendidly at last.

Mr. Bradly gave a very beautiful funeral address.

Mr. Bradly was very tactful. [tactful - тактичный] 

He avoided all dubious  [dubious - сомнительный] points and it was plain to be seen he hoped for the best.

Six reputable citizens of Deerwood bore Cecilia Gay to her grave in decorous Deerwood cemetery. [cemetery - кладбище] 

Among them was Uncle Wellington.  

The Stirlings all came to the funeral, [funeral - похороны]  men and women.

They had had a family conclave over it.

Surely now that Cissy Gay was dead Valancy would come home.

She simply could not stay there with Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущие] Abel.

That being the case, the wisest course—decreed Uncle James—was to attend the funeral— [funeral - похороны] legitimise the whole thing, so to speak—show Deerwood that Valancy had really done a most creditable deed  [deed - дело] in going to nurse poor Cecilia Gay and that her family backed her up in it.

Death, the miracle  [miracle - чудо] worker, suddenly made the thing quite respectable.

If Valancy would return to home and decency while public opinion was under its influence all might yet be well.

Society was suddenly forgetting all Cecilia’s wicked  [wicked - злой] doings and remembering what a pretty, modest  [modest - скромный] little thing she had been—“and motherless, [motherless - безматерь]  [motherless - сирота]  you know—motherless!”

It was the psychological  [psychological - психологический] moment—said Uncle James.  

So the Stirlings went to the funeral. [funeral - похороны] 

Even Cousin Gladys’ neuritis allowed her to come.

Cousin Stickles was there, her bonnet dripping all over her face, crying as woefully as if Cissy had been her nearest and dearest.

Funerals  [Funerals - похороны] always brought Cousin Stickles’ “own sad bereavement” back.  

And Uncle Wellington was a pall-bearer.  

This was not—could not be—the girl who had sat all night in the woods with Barney Snaith—who had gone tearing bareheaded through Deerwood and Port Lawrence.

This was the Valancy they knew.

Really, surprisingly capable and efficient.

Perhaps she had always been kept down a bit too much—Amelia really was rather strict—hadn’t had a chance to show what was in her.

So thought the Stirlings.

And Edward Beck, from the Port road, a widower  [widower - вдовец] with a large family who was beginning to take notice, took notice of Valancy and thought she might make a mighty  [mighty - могучий] fine second wife.

No beauty—but a fifty-year-old widower, [widower - вдовец]  Mr. Beck told himself very reasonably, [reasonably - разумно]  couldn’t expect everything.

Altogether, [Altogether - Вместе]  it seemed that Valancy’s matrimonial chances were never so bright as they were at Cecilia Gay’s funeral. [funeral - похоронный]   

What the Stirlings and Edward Beck would have thought had they known the back of Valancy’s mind must be left to the imagination.

Valancy was hating the funeral— [funeral - похоронный] hating the people who came to stare with curiosity  [curiosity - любопытство] at Cecilia’s marble-white face—hating the smugness—hating the dragging, melancholy singing—hating Mr. Bradly’s cautious  [cautious - осторожный] platitudes.

If she could have had her absurd  [absurd - абсурдный] way, there would have been no funeral  [funeral - похоронный] at all.

She would have covered Cissy over with flowers, shut her away from prying eyes, and buried her beside her nameless  [nameless - безымянный] little baby in the grassy burying-ground under the pines  [pines - сосны] of the “up back” church, with a bit of kindly prayer from the old Free Methodist minister. [minister - министр] 

She remembered Cissy saying once, “I wish I could be buried deep in the heart of the woods where nobody would ever come to say, ‘Cissy Gay is buried here,’ and tell over my miserable  [miserable - жалкий] story.”  

But this!

However, it would soon be over.

Valancy knew, if the Stirlings and Edward Beck didn’t, exactly what she intended to do then.

“My child,” she said tremulously, “you’ll come home _now_?”  

“Home,” said Valancy absently.

She was getting on an apron and calculating how much tea she must put to steep for supper.

There would be several guests from “up back”—distant relatives of the Gays’ who had not remembered them for years.

And she was so tired she wished she could borrow a pair of legs from the cat.  

“Yes, home,” said Mrs. Frederick, with a touch of asperity.

“I suppose you won’t dream of staying here _

now_—alone

with Roaring Abel.”  

“Oh, no, I’m not going to stay _here_,” said Valancy.

“Of course, I’ll have to stay for a day or two, to put the house in order generally.

But that will be all.

Excuse me, Mother, won’t you?

I’ve a frightful lot to do—all those “up back” people will be here to supper.”  

Mrs. Frederick retreated  [retreated - отступивший] in considerable  [considerable - значительный] relief, [relief - облегчение]  and the Stirlings went home with lighter hearts.  

“We will just treat  [treat - угощение] her as if nothing had happened when she comes back,” decreed Uncle Benjamin.

“That will be the best plan.

Just as if nothing had happened.”     

CHAPTER XXV   

On the evening of the day after the funeral  [funeral - похороны] Roaring Abel went off for a spree.

He had been sober  [sober - трезвый] for four whole days and could endure  [endure - терпение] it no longer.

Before he went, Valancy told him she would be going away the next day.

Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel was sorry, and said so.

A distant  [distant - далекий] cousin from “up back” was coming to keep house for him—quite willing  [willing - желающий] to do so now since there was no sick girl to wait on—but Abel was not under any delusions concerning  [concerning - относительно] her.  

“She won’t be like you, my girl.

Well, I’m obliged  [obliged - обязанный] to you.

You helped me out of a bad hole and I won’t forget it.

And I won’t forget what you did for Cissy.

I’m your friend, and if you ever want any of the Stirlings spanked and sot in a corner send for me.

I’m going to wet  [wet - мокрый] my whistle.

Lord, but I’m dry!

Don’t reckon  [reckon - считающийся] I’ll be back afore tomorrow night, so if you’re going home tomorrow, good-bye now.”  

“I _may_ go home tomorrow,” said Valancy, “but I’m not going back to Deerwood.”  

“Not going——”  “You’ll find the key on the woodshed nail,” interrupted Valancy, politely and unmistakably. [unmistakably - безошибочно] 

Don’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes.

The pantry is full and I made bread and pies today.

Good-bye, Mr. Gay.

You have been very kind to me and I appreciate it.”  

“We’ve had a d——d decent  [decent - достойный] time of it together, and that’s a fact,” said Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel.

“You’re the best small sport in the world, and your little finger is worth the whole Stirling clan  [clan - клан] tied together.

Good-bye and good-luck.”  

Valancy went out to the garden.

Her legs trembled a little, but otherwise she felt and looked composed. [composed - составленный] 

She held something tightly in her hand.

The garden was lying in the magic of the warm, odorous July twilight.

A few stars were out and the robins were calling through the velvety silences of the barrens.

Valancy stood by the gate expectantly.

Would he come?

If he did not——  He was coming.

Valancy heard Lady Jane Grey far back in the woods.

Her breath came a little more quickly.

Nearer—and nearer—she could see Lady Jane now—bumping down the lane— [lane - переулок] nearer—nearer—he was there—he had sprung from the car and was leaning  [leaning - наклонный] over the gate, looking at her.  

“Going home, Miss Stirling?”  “I don’t know—yet,” said Valancy slowly.

Her mind was made up, with no shadow of turning, but the moment was very tremendous. [tremendous - огромный]   

“I thought I’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for you,” said Barney.  

Valancy took it with a canter.  

“Yes, there is something you can do for me,” she said, evenly and distinctly.

“Will you marry me?”  

For a moment Barney was silent.

There was no particular  [particular - особый] expression on his face.

Then he gave an odd  [odd - нечетный] laugh.  

“Come, now!

I knew luck was just waiting around the corner for me.

All the signs have been pointing that way today.”  

“Wait.”

Valancy lifted her hand.

“I’m in earnest—but I want to get my breath after that question.

Of course, with my bringing up, I realise perfectly well that this is one of the things ‘a lady should not do.’”  “But why—why?”  

“For two reasons.”

Valancy was still a little breathless, but she looked Barney straight in the eyes, while all the dead Stirlings revolved  [revolved - вращающийся] rapidly in their graves and the living ones did nothing because they did not know that Valancy was at that moment proposing lawful marriage to the notorious  [notorious - пресловутый] Barney Snaith.

“The first reason is, I—I”—Valancy tried to say “I love you” but could not.

She had to take refuge  [refuge - убежище] in a pretended  [pretended - притворный] flippancy.

“I’m crazy about you.

The second is—this.”  

She handed him Dr. Trent’s letter.  

Barney opened it with the air of a man thankful to find some safe, sane  [sane - нормальный] thing to do.

As he read it his face changed.

He understood—more perhaps than Valancy wanted him to.  

“Are you sure nothing can be done for you?”  

Valancy did not misunderstand  [misunderstand - непонимание] the question.  

“Yes.

“You don’t know anything about me.

I may be a—murderer.”  

“No, I don’t.

You _may_ be something dreadful. [dreadful - ужасно] 

Everything they say of you may be true.

But it doesn’t matter to me.”  

“You care that much for me, Valancy?” said Barney incredulously, looking away from the star and into her eyes—her strange, mysterious eyes.  

“I care—that much,” said Valancy in a low voice.

She was trembling.

He had called her by her name for the first time.

It was sweeter than another man’s caress could have been just to hear him say her name like that.  

“If we are going to get married,” said Barney, speaking suddenly in a casual, [casual - небрежно]  matter-of-fact voice, “some things must be understood.”  

“Everything must be understood,” said Valancy.  

“I have things I want to hide,” said Barney coolly.

“You are not to ask me about them.”  

“I won’t,” said Valancy.  

“You must never ask to see my mail.”  

“Never.”  “And we are never to pretend anything to each other.”  

“We won’t,” said Valancy.

“You won’t even have to pretend you like me.

If you marry me I know you’re only doing it out of pity. [pity - жалость] ”  

“And we’ll never tell a lie to each other about anything—a big lie or a petty  [petty - мелко] lie.”  

“Especially a petty  [petty - мелко] lie,” agreed Valancy.  

“And you’ll have to live back on my island.

I won’t live anywhere else.”  

“That’s partly why I want to marry you,” said Valancy.  

Barney peered at her.  

“I believe you mean it.

Well—let’s get married, then.”  

“Thank you,” said Valancy, with a sudden return of primness.

She would have been much less embarrassed if he had refused her.  

“I suppose I haven’t any right to make conditions.

But I’m going to make one.

You are never to refer to my heart or my liability to sudden death.

You are never to urge  [urge - побуждение] me to be careful.

You are to forget—absolutely forget—that I’m not perfectly healthy.

I have written a letter to my mother—here it is—you are to keep it.

I have explained everything in it.

If I drop dead suddenly—as I likely will do——”  “It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion  [suspicion - подозрение] of having poisoned  [poisoned - отравленно] you,” said Barney with a grin. [grin - ухмылка]   

“Exactly.”

Valancy laughed gaily.

“Dear me, I’m glad this is over.

It has been—a bit of an ordeal.

You see, I’m not in the habit of going about asking men to marry me.

It is so nice of you not to refuse me—or offer to be a brother!”  

“I’ll go to the Port tomorrow and get a license.

We can be married tomorrow evening.

Dr. Stalling, I suppose?”  “Heavens, no.”

Valancy shuddered.

“Besides, he wouldn’t do it.

He’d shake his forefinger at me and I’d jilt you at the altar. [altar - алтарь] 

No, I want my old Mr. Towers to marry me.”  

“Will you marry me as I stand?” demanded Barney.

A passing car, full of tourists, honked  [honked - сигналил] loudly—it seemed derisively.

Valancy looked at him.

Blue homespun shirt, nondescript  [nondescript - невзрачно] hat, muddy  [muddy - мутно] overalls.

Unshaved!  

“Yes,” she said.  

Barney put his hands over the gate and took her little, cold ones gently  [gently - нежно] in his.  

“Valancy,” he said, trying to speak lightly, “of course I’m not in love with you—never thought of such a thing as being in love.

But, do you know, I’ve always thought you were a bit of a dear. [dear - дорогой] ”     

CHAPTER XXVI   

The next day passed for Valancy like a dream.

She could not make herself or anything she did seem real.

She saw nothing of Barney, though she expected he must go rattling past on his way to the Port for a license.  

Perhaps he had changed his mind.  

Valancy was waiting at the gate for her bridegroom.

She wore her green dress and her green hat because she had nothing else to wear.

She did not look or feel at all bride-like—she really looked like a wild elf strayed  [strayed - заблудший] out of the greenwood.

But that did not matter.

Nothing at all mattered except that Barney was coming for her.  

“Ready?” said Barney, stopping Lady Jane with some new, horrible noises.  

“Yes.” Valancy stepped in and sat down.

Barney was in his blue shirt and overalls.

But they were clean overalls.

He was smoking a villainous-looking pipe and he was bareheaded.

But he had a pair of oddly  [oddly - странно] smart boots on under his shabby  [shabby - потрепанный] overalls.

And he was shaved.

They clattered into Deerwood and through Deerwood and hit the long, wooded  [wooded - лесистый] road to the Port.  

“Haven’t changed your mind?” said Barney.  

“No.

Have you?”  

“No.”  

That was their whole conversation on the fifteen miles.

Everything was more dream-like than ever.

Valancy didn’t know whether she felt happy.

Or terrified. [terrified - испуганный] 

Or just plain fool. [fool - дурак]   

Then the lights of Port Lawrence were about them.

Valancy felt as if she were surrounded by the gleaming, hungry eyes of hundreds of great, stealthy panthers.

Barney briefly  [briefly - кратко]  [briefly - кратко] asked where Mr. Towers lived, and Valancy as briefly told him.

They stopped before the shabby  [shabby - потертый] little house in an unfashionable  [unfashionable - немодный] street.

They went in to the small, shabby  [shabby - потертый] parlour. [parlour - гостиная] 

Barney produced his license.

So he _had_ got it.

Also a ring.

This thing was real.

She, Valancy Stirling, was actually on the point of being married.  

They were standing up together before Mr. Towers.

Valancy heard Mr. Towers and Barney saying things.

She heard some other person saying things.

She herself was thinking of the way she had once planned to be married—away back in her early teens when such a thing had not seemed impossible.

White silk and tulle veil and orange-blossoms; [blossoms - цветы]  no bridesmaid.

Valancy lifted her eyes and saw herself and Barney in the little, slanting, distorting  [distorting - искажающий] mirror over the mantelpiece.

She in her odd, [odd - странный]  unbridal green hat and dress; Barney in shirt and overalls.

But it was Barney.

That was all that mattered.

No veil—no flowers—no guests—no presents—no wedding-cake—but just Barney.

For all the rest of her life there would be Barney.  

“Mrs. Snaith, I hope you will be very happy,” Mr. Towers was saying.  

He had not seemed surprised at their appearance—not even at Barney’s overalls.

He had seen plenty of queer  [queer - странный] weddings “up back.”

He did not know Valancy was one of the Deerwood Stirlings—he did not even know there _were_

Deerwood Stirlings.

He did not know Barney Snaith was a fugitive from justice.

Really, he was an incredibly ignorant  [ignorant - невежественный] old man.

Therefore he married them and gave them his blessing  [blessing - благословение] very gently  [gently - нежно] and solemnly and prayed for them that night after they had gone away.

His conscience  [conscience - совесть] did not trouble him at all.  

“What a nice way to get married!”

Barney was saying as he put Lady Jane in gear. [gear - снаряжение] 

“No fuss and flub-dub.

I never supposed it was half so easy.”  

“For heaven’s sake, [sake - ради] ” said Valancy suddenly, “let’s forget we _are_ married and talk as if we weren’t.

I can’t stand another drive like the one we had coming in.”  

Barney howled and threw Lady Jane into high with an infernal noise.  

“And I thought I was making it easy for you,” he said.

“You didn’t seem to want to talk.”  

“I didn’t.

But I wanted you to talk.

I don’t want you to make love to me, but I want you to act like an ordinary human being.

Tell me about this island of yours.

What sort of a place is it?”  

“The jolliest place in the world.

You’re going to love it.

The first time I saw it I loved it.

Old Tom MacMurray owned it then.

He built the little shack  [shack - лачуга] on it, lived there in winter and rented it to Toronto people in summer.

I bought it from him—became by that one simple transaction  [transaction - транзакция] a landed proprietor  [proprietor - владелец] owning a house and an island.

There is something so satisfying in owning a whole island.

And isn’t an uninhabited island a charming  [charming - очаровательный] idea?

I’d wanted to own one ever since I’d read _Robinson Crusoe_.

It seemed too good to be true.

And beauty!

Most of the scenery belongs to the government, but they don’t tax you for looking at it, and the moon belongs to everybody.

You won’t find my shack  [shack - хижина] very tidy.

I suppose you’ll want to make it tidy.”  

“Yes,” said Valancy honestly.

“I _have_ to be tidy.

I don’t really _want_ to be.

But untidiness hurts me.

Yes, I’ll have to tidy up your shack. [shack - лачуга] ”  

“No, you’ll only sweep  [sweep - подметать] up after me with the air of a martyr,” said Barney.

“Well, anyway, you can’t tidy the lean-to.

You can’t even enter it.

The door will be locked and I shall keep the key.”  

“Bluebeard’s chamber, [chamber - камера] ” said Valancy.

“I shan’t even think of it.

I don’t care how many wives you have hanging up in it.

So long as they’re really dead.”  “Dead as door-nails.

You can do as you like in the rest of the house.

There’s not much of it—just one big living- [living - жилой] room and one small bedroom.

Well built, though.

Old Tom loved his job.

The beams  [beams - балки] of our house are cedar and the rafters  [rafters - стропила] fir.

Our living- [living - жилой] room windows face west and east.

It’s wonderful to have a room where you can see both sunrise and sunset.

I have two cats there.

Banjo and Good Luck.

Adorable animals.

Banjo is a big, enchanting, [enchanting - феерический]  grey devil- [devil - черт] cat.

Striped, of course.

I don’t care a hang  [hang - вешать] for any cat that hasn’t stripes.

I never knew a cat who could swear as genteelly and effectively  [effectively - эффектно] as Banjo.

His only fault is that he snores  [snores - храпит] horribly when he is asleep.

Luck is a dainty little cat.

Always looking wistfully at you, as if he wanted to tell you something.

Maybe he will pull it off sometime.

Once in a thousand years, you know, one cat is allowed to speak.

My cats are philosophers— [philosophers - философы] neither of them ever cries over spilt milk.  

“Two old crows live in a pine- [pine - сосна] tree on the point and are reasonably  [reasonably - разумно] neighbourly. [neighbourly - по-соседски] 

Call ’em

Nip and Tuck.

Name, Leander.

I brought him up from a baby and he lives over on the mainland  [mainland - материк] and chuckles to himself o’ nights.

And bats— [bats - летучие мыши]  [bats - летучие мыши] it’s a great place for bats at night.

Scared of bats? [bats - летучие мыши] ”  

“No; I like them.”  

“So do I. Nice, queer, [queer - странный]  uncanny, mysterious creatures.

Coming from nowhere—going nowhere.

Swoop!

Banjo likes ’em, too.

Eats ’em.

I have a canoe  [canoe - каноэ] and a disappearing propeller boat.

Went to the Port in it today to get my license.

Quieter than Lady Jane.”  

“I thought you hadn’t gone at all—that you _had_ changed your mind,” admitted Valancy.  

Barney laughed—the laugh Valancy did not like—the little, bitter, cynical  [cynical - циничный] laugh.  

“I never change my mind,” he said shortly. [shortly - коротко]   

They went back through Deerwood.

Up the Muskoka road.

Past Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel’s.

Over the rocky, [rocky - каменистый]  daisied lane. [lane - переулок] 

The dark pine  [pine - сосна] woods swallowed  [swallowed - проглотил] them up.

Through the pine woods, where the air was sweet with the incense  [incense - ладан] of the unseen, fragile  [fragile - хрупкий] bells of the linnæas that carpeted the banks of the trail.

Through it the two enormous pine- [pine - сосна] trees that clasped hands over Barney’s shack  [shack - хижина] loomed  [loomed - вырисовывалась] out like dark turrets.

Behind them was a sky still rose-hued in the afterlight, and a pale young moon.  

Valancy shivered like a tree the wind stirs  [stirs - шевелится] suddenly.

Something seemed to sweep  [sweep - подметать] over her soul.  

“My Blue Castle!”

she said.

“Oh, my Blue Castle!”  

They got into the canoe  [canoe - каноэ] and paddled  [paddled - грести] out to it.

They left behind the realm  [realm - царство]  [realm - царство] of everyday and things known and landed on a realm of mystery and enchantment where anything might happen—anything might be true.

Barney lifted Valancy out of the canoe  [canoe - каноэ] and swung  [swung - качались] her to a lichen-covered rock under a young pine- [pine - сосна] tree.

His arms were about her and suddenly his lips were on hers.

Valancy found herself shivering with the rapture of her first kiss.  

“Welcome home, dear,” Barney was saying.     

CHAPTER XXVII   Cousin Georgiana came down the lane  [lane - переулок] leading up to her little house.

She lived half a mile out of Deerwood and she wanted to go in to Amelia’s and find out if Doss had come home yet.

Cousin Georgiana was anxious to see Doss.

She had something very important to tell her.

Something, she was sure, Doss would be delighted to hear.

Poor Doss!

She _had_ had rather a dull  [dull - тупой] life of it.

Cousin Georgiana owned to herself that _she_ would not like to live under Amelia’s thumb. [thumb - большой палец] 

But that would be all changed now.

Talk about luck.

Cousin Georgiana would have a chance to impart  [impart - передавать] her wonderful secret right away, with nobody else about to interrupt.

It was, you might say, a Providence.  

Valancy, who had been living for four days on her enchanted island, had decided that she might as well go in to Deerwood and tell her relatives that she was married.

Otherwise, finding that she had disappeared from Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel’s, they might get out a search warrant for her.

Barney had offered to drive her in, but she had preferred to go alone.

She smiled very radiantly at Cousin Georgiana, who, she remembered, as of some one known a long time ago, had really been not a bad little creature.

Valancy was so happy that she could have smiled at anybody—even Uncle James.

She was not averse to Cousin Georgiana’s company.

Already, since the houses along the road were becoming numerous, she was conscious that curious  [curious - любопытный] eyes were looking at her from every window.  

“I suppose you’re going home, dear Doss?” said Cousin Georgiana as she shook hands—furtively eyeing Valancy’s dress and wondering if she had _any_ petticoat on at all.  

“Sooner or later,” said Valancy cryptically.  

“Then I’ll go along with you.

I’ve been wanting to see you very especially, Doss dear. [dear - дорогой] 

I’ve something quite _wonderful_ to tell you.”  

“Yes?” said Valancy absently.

What on earth was Cousin Georgiana looking so mysterious and important about?

But did it matter?

No.

Nothing mattered but Barney and the Blue Castle up back in Mistawis.  

“Who do you suppose called to see me the other day?” asked Cousin Georgiana archly.  

Valancy couldn’t guess.  

“Edward Beck.”

Cousin Georgiana lowered  [lowered - пониженный] her voice almost to a whisper.

“_Edward Beck_.”  

Why the italics?

And _was_ Cousin Georgiana blushing? [blushing - краснеющий]   

“Who on earth is Edward Beck?” asked Valancy indifferently.  

Cousin Georgiana stared.  

“Surely you remember Edward Beck,” she said reproachfully.

“He lives in that lovely house on the Port Lawrence road and he comes to our church—regularly.

You _must_ remember him.”  

“Oh, I think I do now,” said Valancy, with an effort of memory.

“He’s that old man with a wen on his forehead and dozens of children, who always sits in the pew by the door, isn’t he?”  

“Not dozens of children, dear—oh, no, not dozens.

Not even _one_ dozen.

Only nine.

At least only nine that count.

The rest are dead.

He isn’t old—he’s only about forty-eight—the prime of life, Doss—and what does it matter about a wen?”  

“Nothing, of course,” agreed Valancy quite sincerely.

It certainly did not matter to her whether Edward Beck had a wen or a dozen wens or no wen at all.

But Valancy was getting vaguely suspicious. [suspicious - подозрительный] 

There was certainly an air of suppressed  [suppressed - подавленный] triumph  [triumph - торжественный] about Cousin Georgiana.

Could it be possible that Cousin Georgiana was thinking of marrying again?

Marrying Edward Beck?

Absurd. [Absurd - абсурдный] 

Cousin Georgiana was sixty-five if she were a day and her little anxious face was as closely covered with fine wrinkles as if she had been a hundred.

But still——  “My dear, [dear - дорогой] ” said Cousin Georgiana, “Edward Beck wants to marry _you_.”  

Valancy stared at Cousin Georgiana for a moment.

Then she wanted to go off into a peal of laughter.

But she only said:  “Me?”  

“Yes, you.

He fell in love with you at the funeral. [funeral - похоронный] 

And he came to consult  [consult - посоветоваться] me about it.

I was such a friend of his first wife, you know.

He is very much in earnest, Dossie.

And it’s a wonderful chance for you.

He’s very well off—and you know—you—you——”  “Am not so young as I once was,” agreed Valancy.

“‘To her that hath shall be given.’

Do you really think I would make a good stepmother, [stepmother - мачеха]  Cousin Georgiana?”  

“I’m sure you would.

You were always so fond  [fond - любящий] of children.”  

“The two oldest are grown up and the third almost.

That leaves only six that really count.

And most of them are boys.

So much easier to bring up than girls.

There’s an excellent book—‘Health Care of the Growing Child’—Gladys has a copy, I think.

It would be such a help to you.

And there are books about morals.

You’d manage nicely. [nicely - красиво] 

Of course I told Mr. Beck that I thought you would—would——”  “Jump at him,” supplied  [supplied - поставляется] Valancy.  

“Oh, no, no, dear.

I wouldn’t use such an indelicate expression.

I told him I thought you would consider his proposal favourably.

And you will, won’t you, dearie?”  “There’s only one obstacle, [obstacle - препятствие] ” said Valancy dreamily. [dreamily - мечтательно] 

“You see, I’m married already.”  

“Married!”

Cousin Georgiana stopped stock- [stock - запас] still and stared at Valancy.

“Married!”  

“Yes.

I was married to Barney Snaith last Tuesday evening in Port Lawrence.”  

There was a convenient gate-post hard by.

Cousin Georgiana took firm  [firm - твердый] hold of it.  

“Doss, dear— [dear - дорогой] I’m an old woman—are you trying to make fun of me?”  

“Not at all.

I’m only telling you the truth.

For heaven’s sake, [sake - ради]  Cousin Georgiana,”—Valancy was alarmed by certain symptoms—“don’t go crying here on the public road!”  

Cousin Georgiana choked back the tears and gave a little moan of despair instead.  

“Oh, Doss, _what_ have you done?

What _have_

you done?”  

“I’ve just been telling you.

I’ve got married,” said Valancy, calmly  [calmly - спокойно] and patiently. [patiently - терпеливо]   

“To that—that—aw—that—_Barney Snaith_.

Why, they say he’s had a dozen wives already.”  

“I’m the only one round at present,” said Valancy.  

“What will your poor mother say?” moaned Cousin Georgiana.  

“Come along with me and hear, if you want to know,” said Valancy.

“I’m on my way to tell her now.”  

Cousin Georgiana let go the gate-post cautiously and found that she could stand alone.

She meekly trotted on beside Valancy—who suddenly seemed quite a different person in her eyes.

Cousin Georgiana had a tremendous  [tremendous - огромный] respect for a married woman.

But it was terrible to think of what the poor girl had done.

So rash. [rash - опрометчивый] 

So reckless.

Of course Valancy must be stark  [stark - резкий] mad.

She had never seen that look in Valancy’s eyes before.

But what _would_

Amelia say?

And Ben?  “To marry a man you know nothing about,” thought Cousin Georgiana aloud.  

“I know more about him than I know of Edward Beck,” said Valancy.  

“Edward Beck _goes to church_,” said Cousin Georgiana.

“Does Bar—does your husband?”  “He has promised that he will go with me on fine Sundays,” said Valancy.  

When they turned in at the Stirling gate Valancy gave an exclamation  [exclamation - восклицание] of surprise.  

“Look at my rosebush!

Why, it’s blooming! [blooming - цветение] ”  

It was.

Covered with blossoms. [blossoms - цветы] 

Great, crimson, velvety blossoms. [blossoms - цветы] 

Fragrant.

Glowing.

Wonderful.  

“My cutting it to pieces must have done it good,” said Valancy, laughing.

She gathered a handful  [handful - горсть] of the blossoms— [blossoms - цветы] they would look well on the supper-table of the verandah  [verandah - веранда] at Mistawis—and went, still laughing, up the walk, conscious that Olive was standing on the steps, Olive, goddess-like in loveliness, [loveliness - красота]  looking down with a slight  [slight - легкий] frown  [frown - хмурый взгляд] on her forehead.

Olive, beautiful, insolent.

Her full form voluptuous in its swathings of rose silk and lace. [lace - кружево] 

Her golden- [golden - золотой] brown hair curling richly under her big, white-frilled hat.

Her colour ripe and melting. [melting - тает]   

“Beautiful,” thought Valancy coolly, “but”—as if she suddenly saw her cousin through new eyes—“without

the slightest  [slightest - мельчайшее] touch of distinction. [distinction - отличие] ”  

She was looking triumphant—graceless!

That outlandish dress—that queer hat—those hands full of blood-red roses. [roses - розы] 

Yet there was something about both dress and hat, as Olive instantly  [instantly - мгновенно] felt, that was entirely lacking  [lacking - отсутствует] in her own attire.

This deepened the frown. [frown - хмурый] 

She put out a condescending hand.  

“So you’re back, Doss?

Very warm day, isn’t it?

Did you walk in?”  

“Yes.

Coming in?”  “Oh, no.

I’ve just been in.

I’ve come often to comfort poor Aunty.

She’s been so lonesome.

I’m going to Mrs. Bartlett’s tea.

I have to help pour.

She’s giving it for her cousin from Toronto.

Such a charming  [charming - очаровательный] girl.

You’d have loved meeting her, Doss.

I think Mrs. Bartlett did send you a card.

Perhaps you’ll drop in later on.”  

“No, I don’t think so,” said Valancy indifferently.

“I’ll have to be home to get Barney’s supper.

We’re going for a moonlit  [moonlit - залитый лунным светом] canoe  [canoe - каноэ] ride around Mistawis tonight.”  

“Barney? Supper?” gasped Olive.

“What _do_

you mean, Valancy Stirling?”  

“Valancy Snaith, by the grace  [grace - грация] of God.”  

Valancy flaunted her wedding-ring in Olive’s stricken face.

Then she nimbly stepped past her and into the house.

Cousin Georgiana followed.

She would not miss a moment of the great scene, even though Olive did look as if she were going to faint. [faint - слабый]   

Olive did not faint.

She went stupidly down the street to Mrs. Bartlett’s.

_

What_ did Doss mean?

She couldn’t have—that ring—oh, what fresh scandal  [scandal - скандал] was that wretched girl bringing on her defenceless  [defenceless - беззащитный] family now?

She should have been—shut up—long ago.  

Valancy opened the sitting- [sitting - сидящий] room door and stepped unexpectedly right into a grim  [grim - мрачный] assemblage of Stirlings.

They had not come together of malice prepense.

Aunt Wellington and Cousin Gladys and Aunt Mildred and Cousin Sarah had just called in on their way home from a meeting of the missionary society.

Uncle James had dropped in to give Amelia some information regarding a doubtful  [doubtful - сомнительный] investment. [investment - инвестиции] 

In all of their minds, unexpressed, was the idea of finding out if Valancy had yet come home, and, if not, what steps must be taken in the matter.  

Well, here was Valancy at last, a poised, confident thing, not humble  [humble - скромный] and deprecating as she should have been.

And so oddly, [oddly - странно]  improperly  [improperly - неправильно] young-looking.

She stood in the doorway  [doorway - дверной] and looked at them, Cousin Georgiana timorous, expectant, [expectant - выжидающий]  behind her.

Valancy was so happy she didn’t hate her people any more.

She could even see a number of good qualities in them that she had never seen before.

And she was sorry for them.

Her pity  [pity - жалость] made her quite gentle.  

“Well, Mother,” she said pleasantly.  

“So you’ve come home at last!” said Mrs. Frederick, getting out a handkerchief.

She dared  [dared - осмелился] not be outraged, but she did not mean to be cheated  [cheated - обманул] of her tears.  

“Well, not exactly,” said Valancy.

She threw her bomb.

“I thought I ought to drop in and tell you I was married.

Last Tuesday night.

To Barney Snaith.”  

Uncle Benjamin bounced  [bounced - отскочил] up and sat down again.  

“God bless  [bless - благослови] my soul!”

he said dully.

The rest seemed turned to stone.

Except Cousin Gladys, who turned faint.

Aunt Mildred and Uncle Wellington had to help her out to the kitchen.  

“She would have to keep up the Victorian  [Victorian - викторианскую] traditions,” said Valancy, with a grin. [grin - ухмылку] 

She sat down, uninvited, [uninvited - незваный]  on a chair.

Cousin Stickles had begun to sob. [sob - всхлип]   

“Is there _one_ day in your life that you haven’t cried?” asked Valancy curiously.  

“Valancy,” said Uncle James, being the first to recover the power of utterance, “did you mean what you said just now?”  “I did.”  

I do not want ever to see your face again.”  

“What have you left to say when I commit murder?” asked Valancy.  

Uncle Benjamin again appealed  [appealed - апеллировал] to God to bless  [bless - благословлял] his soul.  

“That drunken  [drunken - пьяный] outlaw—that——”  A dangerous spark  [spark - искра] appeared in Valancy’s eyes.

They might say what they liked to and of her

but they should not abuse  [abuse - ругань] Barney.  

“Say ‘damn’ and you’ll feel better,” she suggested.  

“I can express my feelings without blasphemy.

And I tell you have covered yourself with eternal  [eternal - вечный] disgrace  [disgrace - позор] and infamy by marrying that drunkard——”  “_You_ would be more endurable if you got drunk occasionally.

Barney is _not_ a drunkard.”  

“He was seen drunk in Port Lawrence—pickled to the gills,” said Uncle Benjamin.  

“If that is true—and I don’t believe it—he had a good reason for it.

Now I suggest that you all stop looking tragic  [tragic - трагический] and accept the situation.

I’m married—you can’t undo that.

And I’m perfectly happy.”  

“I suppose we ought to be thankful he has really married her,” said Cousin Sarah, by way of trying to look on the bright side.  

“If he really has,” said Uncle James, who had just washed his hands of Valancy.

“Who married you?”  “Mr. Towers, of Port Lawrence.”  

“By a Free Methodist!” groaned Mrs. Frederick—as if to have been married by an imprisoned  [imprisoned - заключенный] Methodist would have been a shade less disgraceful.

It was the first thing she had said.

Mrs. Frederick didn’t know _what_ to say.

The whole thing was too horrible—too nightmarish. [nightmarish - кошмарный] 

She was sure she must wake up soon.

After all their bright hopes at the funeral! [funeral - похороны]   

“It makes me think of those what-d’ye-call-’ems,” said Uncle Benjamin helplessly.

“Those yarns—you know—of fairies taking babies out of their cradles.”  

“Valancy could hardly be a changeling at twenty-nine,” said Aunt Wellington satirically.  

“She was the oddest-looking baby I ever saw, anyway,” averred Uncle Benjamin.

“I said so at the time—you remember, Amelia?

I said I had never seen such eyes in a human head.”  

“I’m glad _I_ never had any children,” said Cousin Sarah.

“If they don’t break your heart in one way they do it in another.”  

“Isn’t it better to have your heart broken than to have it wither up?” queried  [queried - допрашивали] Valancy.

“Before it could be broken it must have felt something splendid.

_That_ would be worth the pain.”  

“Dippy—clean dippy,” muttered  [muttered - бормотал] Uncle Benjamin, with a vague, [vague - расплывчато]  unsatisfactory  [unsatisfactory - неудовлетворительно] feeling that somebody had said something like that before.  

“Valancy,” said Mrs. Frederick solemnly, “do you ever pray to be forgiven for disobeying your mother?”  

“But I don’t pray about that at all.

I just thank God every day for my happiness.”  

“I would rather,” said Mrs. Frederick, beginning to cry rather belatedly, “see you dead before me than listen to what you have told me today.”  

Valancy looked at her mother and aunts, and wondered if they could ever have known anything of the real meaning of love.

She felt sorrier for them than ever.

They were so very pitiable.

And they never suspected  [suspected - подозреваемый] it.  

“Barney Snaith is a scoundrel to have deluded you into marrying him,” said Uncle James violently.  

“Oh, _I_ did the deluding.

I asked _him_ to marry me,” said Valancy, with a wicked  [wicked - злой] smile.  

“Have you _no_ pride? [pride - гордость] ” demanded Aunt Wellington.  

“Lots of it.

I am proud that I have achieved a husband by my own unaided  [unaided - без посторонней помощи] efforts.

Cousin Georgiana here wanted to help me to Edward Beck.”  

“Edward Beck is worth twenty thousand dollars and has the finest house between here and Port Lawrence,” said Uncle Benjamin.  

“That sounds very fine,” said Valancy scornfully, [scornfully - пренебрежительно]  “but it isn’t worth _

that_“—she snapped  [snapped - надломленный] her fingers—“compared to feeling Barney’s arms around me and his cheek  [cheek - щека] against mine.”  

“_Oh_, Doss!” said Cousin Stickles.

Cousin Sarah said, “Oh, _Doss_!”

Aunt Wellington said, “Valancy, you need not be indecent.”  

“Why, it surely isn’t indecent to like to have your husband put his arm around you?

I should think it would be indecent if you didn’t.”  

“Why expect decency from her?” inquired Uncle James sarcastically. [sarcastically - саркастически] 

“She has cut herself off from decency forevermore.

She has made her bed.

Let her lie on it.”  

“Thanks,” said Valancy very gratefully.

“How you would have enjoyed being Torquemada!

Now, I must really be getting back.

Mother, may I have those three woollen  [woollen - шерстяной] cushions I worked last winter?”  

“Take them—take everything!” said Mrs. Frederick.  

“Oh, I don’t want everything—or much.

I don’t want my Blue Castle cluttered. [cluttered - загроможденный] 

Just the cushions.

I’ll call for them some day when we motor in.”  

Valancy rose and went to the door.

There she turned.

She was sorrier than ever for them all.

_

They_ had no Blue Castle in the purple solitudes of Mistawis.  

“The trouble with you people is that you don’t laugh enough,” she said.  

“Doss, dear, [dear - дорогой] ” said Cousin Georgiana mournfully, “some day you will discover that blood is thicker than water.”  

“Of course it is.

But who wants water to be thick?” parried Valancy.

“We want water to be thin—sparkling— [sparkling - искрящийся] crystal- [crystal - хрустальный] clear.”  

Cousin Stickles groaned.  

Valancy would not ask any of them to come and see her—she was afraid they _would_ come out of curiosity. [curiosity - любопытство] 

But she said:  “Do you mind if I drop in and see you once in a while, Mother?”  

“I dare  [dare - дерзко] say the marriage isn’t legal,” said Uncle James comfortingly.

“He has probably been married half a dozen times before.

But _I_ am through with her.

I have done all I could, Amelia.

I think you will admit that.

Henceforth”—Uncle

James was terribly  [terribly - ужасно] solemn about it—“Valancy is to me as one dead.”  

“Mrs. Barney Snaith,” said Cousin Georgiana, as if trying it out to see how it would sound.  

“He has a score of aliases, no doubt,” said Uncle Benjamin.

“For my part, I believe the man is half Indian.

I haven’t a doubt they’re living in a wigwam.”  

“If he has married her under the name of Snaith and it isn’t his real name wouldn’t that make the marriage null and void?” asked Cousin Stickles hopefully. [hopefully - надеюсь]   

Uncle James shook his head.  

“No, it is the man who marries, not the name.”  

“You know,” said Cousin Gladys, who had recovered and returned but was still shaky, [shaky - шатко]  “I had a distinct  [distinct - отчётливо] premonition of this at Herbert’s silver dinner.

I remarked it at the time.

When she was defending Snaith.

You remember, of course.

It came over me like a revelation. [revelation - откровение] 

I spoke to David when I went home about it.”  

“What—_what_,” demanded Aunt Wellington of the universe, “has come over Valancy? _Valancy_!”  

The universe did not answer but Uncle James did.  

“Isn’t there something coming up of late about secondary  [secondary - вторично] personalities cropping out?

I don’t hold with many of those new-fangled notions, but there may be something in this one.

It would account for her incomprehensible conduct.”  

“Valancy is so fond  [fond - люблю] of mushrooms,” sighed  [sighed - вздохнул] Cousin Georgiana.

“I’m afraid she’ll get poisoned  [poisoned - отравил] eating toadstools by mistake living up back in the woods.”  

“There are worse things than death,” said Uncle James, believing that it was the first time in the world that such a statement had been made.  

“Nothing can ever be the same again!”

sobbed  [sobbed - всхлипнул] Cousin Stickles.  

Valancy, hurrying along the dusty road, back to cool Mistawis and her purple island, had forgotten all about them—just as she had forgotten that she might drop dead at any moment if she hurried.     

CHAPTER XXVIII   Summer passed by.

The Stirling clan— [clan - клан] with the insignificant exception  [exception - исключение] of Cousin Georgiana—had tacitly agreed to follow Uncle James’ example and look upon Valancy as one dead.

To be sure, Valancy had an unquiet, ghostly habit of recurring resurrections when she and Barney clattered through Deerwood and out to the Port in that unspeakable car.

Valancy, bareheaded, with stars in her eyes.

Barney, bareheaded, smoking his pipe.

But shaved.

Always shaved now, if any of them had noticed it.

They even had the audacity to go in to Uncle Benjamin’s store to buy groceries. [groceries - бакалея] 

Twice Uncle Benjamin ignored them.

Was not Valancy one of the dead?

While Snaith had never existed.

“I have made her happy,” he said coolly, “and she was miserable  [miserable - несчастный] with her friends.

So that’s that.”  

Uncle Benjamin stared.

It had never occurred to him that women had to be, or ought to be, “made happy.”  

“You—you pup!”

he said.  

“Why be so unoriginal?” queried  [queried - вопрошанный] Barney amiably.

“Anybody could call me a pup.

Why not think of something worthy  [worthy - достойный] of the Stirlings?

Besides, I’m not a pup.

I’m really quite a middle-aged dog.

Thirty-five, if you’re interested in knowing.”  

Uncle Benjamin remembered just in time that Valancy was dead.

He turned his back on Barney.  

Valancy _was_ happy—gloriously and entirely so.

She seemed to be living in a wonderful house of life and every day opened a new, mysterious room.

It was in a world which had nothing in common with the one she had left behind—a world where time was not—which was young with immortal  [immortal - бессмертный] youth—where there was neither past nor future but only the present.

She surrendered  [surrendered - преданный] herself utterly  [utterly - совершенно] to the charm  [charm - прелесть] of it.  

The absolute freedom of it all was unbelievable.

They could do exactly as they liked.

No Mrs. Grundy.

No traditions.

No relatives.

Or in-laws.

“Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away,” as Barney quoted  [quoted - цитируемый] shamelessly.  

Valancy had gone home once and got her cushions.

And Cousin Georgiana had given her one of her famous candlewick spreads of most elaborate  [elaborate - разработанный] design.

“For your spare- [spare - запасной] room bed, dear,” she said.  

“But I haven’t got any spare- [spare - запасной] room,” said Valancy.  

Cousin Georgiana looked horrified. [horrified - в ужасе] 

A house without a spare- [spare - запасной] room was monstrous to her.  

“But it’s a lovely spread,” said Valancy, with a kiss, “and I’m so glad to have it.

I’ll put it on my own bed.

Barney’s old patch- [patch - патч] work quilt is getting ragged.”  

“I don’t see how you can be contented to live up back,” sighed  [sighed - вздохнул] Cousin Georgiana.

“It’s so out of the world.”  

“Contented!”

Valancy laughed.

What was the use of trying to explain to Cousin Georgiana.

“It is,” she agreed, “most gloriously and entirely out of the world.”  

“And you are really happy, dear?” asked Cousin Georgiana wistfully.  

“When it’s going to last long,” agreed Valancy.  

Cousin Georgiana did not understand this at all.

But it worried her and she lay awake at nights wondering what Valancy meant by it.  

Valancy loved her Blue Castle and was completely satisfied with it.

The big living- [living - живые] room had three windows, all commanding exquisite  [exquisite - изысканные]  [exquisite - изысканные] views of exquisite Mistawis.

The one in the end of the room was an oriel window—which Tom MacMurray, Barney explained, had got out of some little, old “up back” church that had been sold.

It faced the west and when the sunsets flooded it Valancy’s whole being knelt  [knelt - преклонили колени] in prayer as if in some great cathedral. [cathedral - собор] 

The new moons always looked down through it, the lower pine  [pine - сосна] boughs swayed about the top of it, and all through the nights the soft, dim  [dim - тусклый] silver of the lake dreamed through it.  

There was a stone fireplace  [fireplace - камин] on the other side.

No desecrating gas imitation  [imitation - имитация] but a real fireplace  [fireplace - камин] where you could burn real logs.

With a big grizzly bearskin on the floor before it, and beside it a hideous, red-plush sofa of Tom MacMurray’s régime.

But its ugliness was hidden by silver-grey timber  [timber - дерево] wolf  [wolf - волк] skins, and Valancy’s cushions made it gay  [gay - веселый] and comfortable.

In a corner a nice, tall, lazy old clock ticked—the right kind of a clock.

One that did not hurry the hours away but ticked them off deliberately. [deliberately - нарочито] 

It was the jolliest looking old clock.

A fat, corpulent clock with a great, round, man’s face painted on it, the hands stretching out of its nose and the hours encircling it like a halo.  

Some comfortable old chairs that asked to be sat upon.

A squat little chair with a cushion was prescriptively Banjo’s.

If anybody else dared  [dared - осмелился] sit on it Banjo glared him out of it with his topaz-hued, black-ringed eyes.

Banjo had an adorable habit of hanging over the back of it, trying to catch his own tail. [tail - хвост] 

Losing his temper because he couldn’t catch it.

Giving it a fierce  [fierce - жестокий] bite for spite  [spite - злоба] when he _did_ catch it.

Yowling malignantly with pain.

Barney and Valancy laughed at him until they ached. [ached - болел] 

But it was Good Luck they loved.

They were both agreed that Good Luck was so lovable that he practically  [practically - практически] amounted to an obsession. [obsession - одержимость]   

One side of the wall was lined  [lined - подкладка] with rough, homemade book-shelves filled with books, and between the two side windows hung an old mirror in a faded gilt frame, with fat cupids gamboling in the panel  [panel - панель] over the glass.

A mirror, Valancy thought, that must be like the fabled mirror into which Venus had once looked and which thereafter reflected as beautiful every woman who looked into it.

Valancy thought she was almost pretty in that mirror.

But that may have been because she had shingled her hair.  

This was before the day of bobs and was regarded as a wild, unheard-of proceeding—unless you had typhoid. [typhoid - тиф] 

When Mrs. Frederick heard of it she almost decided to erase  [erase - стирать] Valancy’s name from the family Bible.

Barney cut the hair, square off at the back of Valancy’s neck, bringing it down in a short black fringe over her forehead.

It gave a meaning and a purpose to her little, three-cornered face that it never had possessed before.

Even her nose ceased  [ceased - прекратил] to irritate her.

Her eyes were bright, and her sallow skin had cleared to the hue of creamy  [creamy - кремовый] ivory.

The old family joke had come true—she was really fat at last—anyway, no longer skinny.

Valancy might never be beautiful, but she was of the type that looks its best in the woods—elfin—mocking—alluring.  

Her heart bothered her very little.

When an attack threatened  [threatened - угрожало] she was generally able to head it off with Dr. Trent’s prescription. [prescription - рецепт] 

But the rest of the time she would not—did not—let herself remember it at all.     

CHAPTER XXIX   Valancy toiled  [toiled - трудится] not, neither did she spin. [spin - крутиться] 

There was really very little work to do.

She cooked their meals on a coal-oil stove, performing all her little domestic  [domestic - домашнее] rites  [rites - обряды] carefully and exultingly, and they ate out on the verandah  [verandah - веранда] that almost overhung the lake.

Before them lay Mistawis, like a scene out of some fairy tale of old time.

And Barney smiling his twisted, [twisted - извилистый]  enigmatical smile at her across the table.  

“What a view old Tom picked out when he built this shack! [shack - лачуга] ”

Barney would say exultantly.  

Supper was the meal Valancy liked best.

The faint laughter of winds was always about them and the colours of Mistawis, imperial  [imperial - императорский] and spiritual, under the changing clouds were something that cannot be expressed in mere  [mere - просто] words.

Shadows, too.

Clustering in the pines  [pines - сосны] until a wind shook them out and pursued them over Mistawis.

They lay all day along the shores, [shores - берега]  threaded by ferns and wild blossoms. [blossoms - цветы] 

They stole around the headlands in the glow  [glow - сияние] of the sunset, until twilight wove them all into one great web of dusk. [dusk - сумерки]   

The cats, with their wise, innocent little faces, would sit on the verandah  [verandah - веранда] railing and eat the tidbits Barney flung them.

And how good everything tasted!

Barney paid her no end of compliments on her cooking.  

“After all,” he admitted, “there’s something to be said for square meals.

I’ve mostly got along by boiling two or three dozen eggs hard at once and eating a few when I got hungry, with a slice of bacon once in a while and a jorum of tea.”  

Valancy poured tea out of Barney’s little battered  [battered - потрепанный] old pewter teapot of incredible age.

She had not even a set of dishes—only Barney’s mismatched  [mismatched - несоответствующий] chipped bits—and a dear, big, pobby old jug of robin’s-egg blue.  

After the meal was over they would sit there and talk for hours—or sit and say nothing, in all the languages of the world, Barney pulling away at his pipe, Valancy dreaming idly  [idly - праздно] and deliciously, gazing at the far-off hills beyond Mistawis where the spires of firs came out against the sunset.

The moonlight  [moonlight - лунный свет] would begin to silver the Mistawis dusk. [dusk - сумерки] 

Bats  [Bats - Летучие мыши] would begin to swoop darkly  [darkly - темно] against the pale, western  [western - западный] gold.

The little waterfall that came down on the high bank not far away would, by some whim  [whim - прихоть] of the wildwood gods, [gods - боги]  begin to look like a wonderful white woman beckoning through the spicy, fragrant evergreens.

And Leander would begin to chuckle diabolically on the mainland  [mainland - материк] shore. [shore - берег] 

How sweet it was to sit there and do nothing in the beautiful silence, with Barney at the other side of the table, smoking!  

There were plenty of other islands in sight, though none were near enough to be troublesome  [troublesome - проблемный] as neighbours.

There was one little group of islets far off to the west which they called the Fortunate Isles.

At sunrise they looked like a cluster  [cluster - скопление]  [cluster - скопление] of emeralds, at sunset like a cluster of amethysts.

Music would drift  [drift - дрифт] to them alluringly from boats here and there, or from the verandahs on the big house of the millionaire  [millionaire - миллионер] on the biggest island.  

“Would you like a house like that, Moonlight?”

Barney asked once, waving his hand at it.

He had taken to calling her Moonlight, and Valancy loved it.  

“No,” said Valancy, who had once dreamed of a mountain castle ten times the size of the rich man’s “cottage” [cottage - коттедж]  and now pitied the poor inhabitants  [inhabitants - жители] of palaces.

“No.

It’s too elegant. [elegant - элегантный] 

I would have to carry it with me everywhere I went.

On my back like a snail. [snail - улитка] 

It would own me—possess me, body and soul.

I like a house I can love and cuddle and boss.

Just like ours here.

I don’t envy  [envy - зависть] Hamilton Gossard ‘the finest summer residence  [residence - резиденция] in Canada.’

It is magnificent, [magnificent - великолепный]  but it isn’t my Blue Castle.”  

Away down at the far  [far - далеко] end of the lake they got every night a glimpse  [glimpse - заглянуть] of a big, continental train rushing through a clearing.

Valancy liked to watch its lighted windows flash  [flash - вспышка] by and wonder who was on it and what hopes and fears it carried.

She also amused  [amused - развлекался] herself by picturing  [picturing - рисовал] Barney and herself going to the dances and dinners in the houses on the islands, but she did not want to go in reality.

From the smells that filtered through at times she concluded he must be conducting  [conducting - проводящий] chemical experiments—or counterfeiting money.

Valancy supposed there must be smelly processes in making counterfeit money.

But she did not trouble herself about it.

She had no desire to peer  [peer - равный] into the locked chambers  [chambers - камеры] of Barney’s house of life.

His past and his future concerned  [concerned - обеспокоенный] her not.

Only this rapturous present.

Nothing else mattered.  

Once he went away and stayed away two days and nights.

He had asked Valancy if she would be afraid to stay alone and she had said she would not.

He never told her where he had been.

She was not afraid to be alone, but she was horribly lonely.

The sweetest sound she had ever heard was Lady Jane’s clatter through the woods when Barney returned.

And then his signal whistle from the shore. [shore - берег] 

She ran down to the landing  [landing - приземляющийся] rock to greet him—to nestle herself into his eager  [eager - нетерпеливый]  [eager - нетерпеливый] arms—they _did_ seem eager.  

“Have you missed me, Moonlight?”

Barney was whispering. [whispering - шепчущий]   

“It seems a hundred years since you went away,” said Valancy.  

“I won’t leave you again.”  

“You must,” protested  [protested - протестующий] Valancy, “if you want to.

I’d be miserable  [miserable - жалкий] if I thought you wanted to go and didn’t, because of me.

I want you to feel perfectly free.”  

Barney laughed—a little cynically. [cynically - цинично]   

“There is no such thing as freedom on earth,” he said.

“Only different kinds of bondages.

And comparative  [comparative - сравнительный] bondages.

_

You_ think you are free now because you’ve escaped from a peculiarly unbearable  [unbearable - невыносимый] kind of bondage.

But are you?

You love me—_that’s_ a bondage.”  

When I came down through the woods and saw my home lights—mine—gleaming out under the old pines— [pines - сосны] something I’d never seen before—oh, girl, I was glad—glad!”  

But in spite  [spite - злоба] of Barney’s doctrine  [doctrine - учение] of bondage, Valancy thought they were splendidly free.

It was amazing to be able to sit up half the night and look at the moon if you wanted to.

To be late for meals if you wanted to—she who had always been rebuked so sharply  [sharply - резко] by her mother and so reproachfully by Cousin Stickles if she were one minute late.

Dawdle over meals as long as you wanted to.

Leave your crusts if you wanted to.

Not come home at all for meals if you wanted to.

Sit on a sun-warm rock and paddle  [paddle - весло] your bare  [bare - голый] feet in the hot sand if you wanted to.

Just sit and do nothing in the beautiful silence if you wanted to.

In short, do any fool  [fool - дурак] thing you wanted to whenever the notion took you.

If _that_ wasn’t freedom, what was?     

CHAPTER XXX   

They didn’t spend all their days on the island.

They spent more than half of them wandering  [wandering - бродячий] at will through the enchanted Muskoka country.

Barney knew the woods as a book and he taught their lore and craft  [craft - ремесло] to Valancy.

He could always find trail and haunt  [haunt - преследовать] of the shy wood people.

Valancy learned the different fairy-likenesses of the mosses—the charm  [charm - очарование] and exquisiteness of woodland blossoms. [blossoms - цветы] 

She learned to know every bird at sight and mimic  [mimic - мимикрировать] its call—though never so perfectly as Barney.

She made friends with every kind of tree.

She learned to paddle  [paddle - весло] a canoe  [canoe - каноэ] as well as Barney himself.

She liked to be out in the rain and she never caught cold.  

Sometimes they took a lunch with them and went berrying—strawberries and blueberries.

And Valancy learned the real flavour  [flavour - аромат] of the strawberry in its highest perfection.

There was a certain sunlit dell on the banks of Mistawis along which white birches grew on one side and on the other still, changeless ranks of young spruces.

There were long grasses at the roots of the birches, combed  [combed - гребенчатый] down by the winds and wet with morning dew late into the afternoons.

Here they found berries  [berries - ягоды] that might have graced the banquets of Lucullus, great ambrosial sweetnesses hanging like rubies to long, rosy  [rosy - розовый] stalks.

They lifted them by the stalk and ate them from it, uncrushed and virgin, tasting each berry  [berry - ягодный] by itself with all its wild fragrance  [fragrance - аромат] ensphered therein.

When Valancy carried any of these berries  [berries - ягоды]  [berries - ягоды] home that elusive  [elusive - неуловимый] essence  [essence - эссенция] escaped and they became nothing more than the common berries of the market-place—very kitchenly good indeed, but not as they would have been, eaten in their birch dell until her fingers were stained  [stained - витражный] as pink as Aurora’s eyelids. [eyelids - веки]   

Or they went after water-lilies.

Barney knew where to find them in the creeks  [creeks - ручьи] and bays  [bays - бухты] of Mistawis.

Sometimes they went trouting on little nameless  [nameless - безымянный] rivers or hidden brooks on whose banks Naiads might have sunned their white, wet limbs. [limbs - конечности] 

Then all they took with them were some raw potatoes and salt.

They roasted the potatoes over a fire and Barney showed Valancy how to cook the trout by wrapping them in leaves, coating them with mud and baking them in a bed of hot coals.

Never were such delicious meals.

Valancy had such an appetite  [appetite - аппетит] it was no wonder she put flesh  [flesh - плоть] on her bones.  

Or they just prowled  [prowled - крался] and explored through woods that always seemed to be expecting something wonderful to happen.

At least, that was the way Valancy felt about them.

Down the next hollow— [hollow - полый] over the next hill—you would find it.  

“We don’t know where we’re going, but isn’t it fun to go?”

Barney used to say.  

Once or twice night overtook  [overtook - нагнал] them, too far from their Blue Castle to get back.

But Barney made a fragrant bed of bracken and fir boughs and they slept on it dreamlessly, under a ceiling  [ceiling - потолок] of old spruces with moss hanging from them, while beyond them moonlight  [moonlight - лунный свет] and the murmur  [murmur - бормотание] of pines  [pines - сосны] blended together so that one could hardly tell which was light and which was sound. [sound - звук]   

There were rainy days, of course, when Muskoka was a wet green land.

Days when showers drifted  [drifted - дрейфовал] across Mistawis like pale ghosts of rain and they never thought of staying in because of it.

Days when it rained in right good  [good - хороший] earnest

and they had to stay in.

One felt really too happy for Sunday.

Valancy had never really liked Sundays before.  

And always, Sundays and weekdays, she was with Barney.

Nothing else really mattered.

And what a companion  [companion - компаньон] he was!

How understanding! [understanding - понимание] 

How jolly!

How—how Barney—like!

That summed it all up.  

Valancy had taken some of her two hundred dollars out of the bank and spent it in pretty clothes.

She had a little smoke-blue chiffon which she always put on when they spent the evening at home—smoke-blue with touches of silver about it.

It was after she began wearing it that Barney began calling her Moonlight.  

“Moonlight and blue twilight—that is what you look like in that dress.

I like it.

It belongs to you.

You aren’t exactly pretty, but you have some adorable beauty-spots.

Your eyes.

And that little kissable dent just between your collar bones.

You have the wrist  [wrist - запястье] and ankle of an aristocrat. [aristocrat - аристократ] 

That little head of yours is beautifully shaped.

And when you look backward  [backward - отсталый] over your shoulder you’re maddening—especially in twilight or moonlight. [moonlight - лунный свет] 

An elf maiden.

A wood sprite.

You belong to the woods, Moonlight—you should never be out of them.

In spite  [spite - злоба] of your ancestry, there is something wild and remote and untamed about you.

And you have such a nice, sweet, throaty, summery voice.

Such a nice voice for love-making. [making - делающий] ”  

“Shure an’ ye’ve kissed the Blarney Stone,” scoffed  [scoffed - осмеянный] Valancy.

But she tasted these compliments for weeks.  

She got a pale green bathing-suit, too—a garment which would have given her clan  [clan - клан] their deaths if they had ever seen her in it.

Barney taught her how to swim.

Sometimes she put her bathing-dress on when she got up and didn’t take it off until she went to bed—running down to the water for a plunge  [plunge - окунание] whenever she felt like it and sprawling  [sprawling - расползание] on the sun-warm rocks to dry.  

She had forgotten all the old humiliating  [humiliating - унижение] things that used to come up against her in the night—the injustices  [injustices - несправедливости] and the disappointments. [disappointments - разочарования] 

It was as if they had all happened to some other person—not to her, Valancy Snaith, who had always been happy.  

“I understand now what it means to be born again,” she told Barney.  

She found it hard to believe that she had ever been lonely and unhappy and afraid.  

“When death comes, I shall have lived,” thought Valancy.

“I shall have had my hour.”  

And her dust-pile!  

One day Valancy had heaped  [heaped - нагроможденный] up the sand in the little island cove in a tremendous  [tremendous - огромный] cone  [cone - конус] and stuck a gay  [gay - веселый] little Union Jack on top of it.  

“What are you celebrating?”

Barney wanted to know.  

“I’m just exorcising an old demon, [demon - демон] ” Valancy told him.     

CHAPTER XXXI   Autumn came.

Late September with cool nights.

They had to forsake the verandah; [verandah - веранда]  but they kindled a fire in the big fireplace  [fireplace - камин] and sat before it with jest and laughter.

They left the doors open, and Banjo and Good Luck came and went at pleasure.

Sometimes they sat gravely  [gravely - гравийный] on the bearskin rug  [rug - коврик] between Barney and Valancy; sometimes they slunk off into the mystery of the chill  [chill - холод] night outside.

The stars smouldered in the horizon  [horizon - горизонт] mists  [mists - туманы] through the old oriel.

The haunting, [haunting - навязчивый]  persistent  [persistent - настойчивый] croon of the pine- [pine - сосна] trees filled the air.

They needed no light but the firelight that sometimes leaped up and revealed them—sometimes shrouded them in shadow.

When the night wind rose higher Barney would shut the door and light a lamp and read to her—poetry and essays and gorgeous, [gorgeous - великолепный]  dim  [dim - тусклый] chronicles of ancient wars.

Barney never would read novels: he vowed  [vowed - поклявшийся] they bored him.

But sometimes she read them herself, curled up on the wolf  [wolf - волк] skins, laughing aloud in peace.

For Barney was not one of those aggravating people who can never hear you smiling audibly over something you’ve read without inquiring placidly, [placidly - безмятежно]  “What is the joke?”  October—with a gorgeous  [gorgeous - великолепный] pageant of color around Mistawis, into which Valancy plunged  [plunged - погруженный] her soul.

Never had she imagined anything so splendid.

A great, tinted peace.

Blue, wind-winnowed skies.

Sunlight sleeping in the glades of that fairyland.

Long dreamy  [dreamy - мечтательный] purple days paddling  [paddling - гребущий] idly  [idly - праздно] in their canoe  [canoe - каноэ] along shores  [shores - берега] and up the rivers of crimson and gold.

A sleepy, red hunter’s moon.

Enchanted tempests that stripped  [stripped - раздетый] the leaves from the trees and heaped  [heaped - наваленный] them along the shores. [shores - берега] 

Flying shadows of clouds.

With dear days when the austere woods were beautiful and gracious in a dignified serenity of folded hands and closed eyes—days full of a fine, pale sunshine that sifted through the late, leafless gold of the juniper-trees and glimmered among the grey beeches, lighting up evergreen banks of moss and washing the colonnades of the pines. [pines - сосны] 

Days with a high-sprung sky of flawless  [flawless - безупречный] turquoise.

Days when an exquisite  [exquisite - изысканный] melancholy seemed to hang over the landscape and dream about the lake.

But days, too, of the wild blackness  [blackness - чернота] of great autumn storms, followed by dank, wet, streaming  [streaming - поток] nights when there was witch-laughter in the pines  [pines - сосны] and fitful moans among the mainland  [mainland - материк] trees.

What cared they?

Old Tom had built his roof well, and his chimney  [chimney - дымоход] drew.  

“Warm fire—books—comfort—safety from storm—our cats on the rug. [rug - коврик] 

Moonlight,” said Barney, “would you be any happier now if you had a million dollars?”  

“No—nor half so happy.

I’d be bored by conventions  [conventions - конвенции] and obligations  [obligations - обязательства] then.”  

December.

Early snows and Orion.

The pale fires of the Milky Way.

It was really winter now—wonderful, cold, starry  [starry - звездный] winter.

How Valancy had always hated winter!

Dull, [Dull - Скучный]  brief, uneventful  [uneventful - без происшествий] days.

Long, cold, companionless nights.

Cousin Stickles whining over the price of coal.

Her mother, probing, questioning, [questioning - вопрошание]  ignoring.

Endless  [Endless - Бесконечный] colds and bronchitis—or the dread of it.

Redfern’s Liniment and Purple Pills.  

But now she loved winter.

Winter was beautiful “up back”—almost intolerably beautiful.

Days of clear brilliance. [brilliance - блеск] 

Evenings that were like cups of glamour— [glamour - гламур] the purest vintage of winter’s wine.

Nights with their fire of stars.

Cold, exquisite  [exquisite - изысканность] winter sunrises.

Lovely ferns of ice all over the windows of the Blue Castle.

Moonlight  [Moonlight - Лунный свет] on birches in a silver thaw.

Ragged shadows on windy evenings—torn, twisted, [twisted - скрученный]  fantastic shadows.

Great silences, austere and searching.

Jewelled, barbaric hills.

The sun suddenly breaking through grey clouds over long, white Mistawis.

Icy- [Icy - Ледяной] grey twilights, broken by snow-squalls, when their cosy living- [living - живой] room, with its goblins of firelight and inscrutable cats seemed cosier than ever.

Every hour brought a new revelation  [revelation - откровение] and wonder.  

Barne [barn - амбар] y ran Lady Jane into Roaring  [Roaring - Ревущий] Abel’s barn and taught Valancy how to snowshoe—Valancy, who ought to be laid up with bronchitis.

But Valancy had not even a cold.

Later on in the winter Barney had a terrible one and Valancy nursed him through it with a dread of pneumonia  [pneumonia - пневмония] in her heart.

But Valancy’s colds seemed to have gone where old moons go.

Which was luck—for she hadn’t even Redfern’s Liniment.

She had thoughtfully  [thoughtfully - задумчиво] bought a bottle at the Port and Barney had hurled it into frozen Mistawis with a scowl.  

“Bring no more of that devilish stuff here,” he had ordered briefly. [briefly - кратко] 

It was the first and last time he had spoken harshly to her.  

At times they seemed to be walking through a spellbound  [spellbound - завороженный] world of crystal and pearl, [pearl - жемчуг]  so white and radiant were clearings and lakes and sky.

The air was so crisp  [crisp - четкость] and clear that it was half intoxicating.  

Once they stood in a hesitation  [hesitation - колебание] of ecstasy at the entrance of a narrow path between ranks of birches.

Every twig and spray  [spray - брызги] was outlined in snow.

The undergrowth along its sides was a little fairy forest cut out of marble.

The shadows cast  [cast - бросок] by the pale sunshine were fine and spiritual.  

“Come away,” said Barney, turning.

“We must not commit the desecration of tramping through there.”  

One evening they came upon a snowdrift far back in an old clearing which was in the exact likeness of a beautiful woman’s profile. [profile - профиль] 

Seen too close by, the resemblance was lost, as in the fairy-tale of the Castle of St. John.

Seen from behind, it was a shapeless oddity. [oddity - странность] 

But at just the right distance and angle  [angle - угол] the outline  [outline - контур] was so perfect that when they came suddenly upon it, gleaming out against the dark background of spruce in the glow  [glow - сияние] of that winter sunset they both exclaimed  [exclaimed - воскликнул] in amazement. [amazement - изумление] 

“‘All the beauty that old Greece and Rome, sung painted, taught,’” quoted  [quoted - цитируемая] Barney.  

“And to think no human eyes save ours have seen or will see it,” breathed Valancy, who felt at times as if she were living in a book by John Foster.

As she looked around her she recalled some passages she had marked in the new Foster book Barney had brought her from the Port—with an adjuration not to expect _him_ to read or listen to it.  

“‘All the tintings of winter woods are extremely delicate  [delicate - нежная] and elusive, [elusive - неуловимая] ’” recalled Valancy.

“‘When the brief afternoon wanes and the sun just touches the tops of the hills, there seems to be all over the woods an abundance, [abundance - изобилие]  not of colour, but of the spirit of colour.

There is really nothing but pure white after all, but one has the impression of fairy-like blendings of rose  [rose - роза] and violet, opal and heliotrope on the slopes—in the dingles and along the curves of the forest-land.

You feel sure the tint is there, but when you look at it directly it is gone.

From the corner of your eye you are aware that it is lurking over yonder in a spot where there was nothing but pale purity  [purity - чистота] a moment ago.

Only just when the sun is setting is there a fleeting  [fleeting - мимолетное] moment of real colour.

Then the redness streams out over the snow and incarnadines the hills and rivers and smites the crest of the pines  [pines - сосны] with flame. [flame - пламя] 

Just a few minutes of transfiguration and revelation— [revelation - откровение] and it is gone.’”  

“I wonder if John Foster ever spent a winter in Mistawis,” said Valancy.  

“Not likely,” scoffed  [scoffed - насмешливое] Barney.

“People who write tosh like that generally write it in a warm house on some smug  [smug - самодовольное] city street.”  

“You are too hard on John Foster,” said Valancy severely. [severely - сурово] 

“No one could have written that little paragraph I read you last night without having seen it first—you know he couldn’t.”  

“I didn’t listen to it,” said Barney morosely.

“You know I told you I wouldn’t.”  

“Then you’ve got to listen to it now,” persisted  [persisted - настойчивое] Valancy.

She made him stand still on his snowshoes while she repeated it.  

“‘She is a rare artist, this old Mother Nature, who works “for the joy of working” and not in any spirit of vain show.

Today the fir woods are a symphony of greens and greys, so subtle  [subtle - тонкое] that you cannot tell where one shade begins to be the other.

She must have a dash  [dash - рывок] of colour.

See it.

A broken dead fir bough, of a beautiful red-brown, swinging among the beards of moss.’”  

“Good Lord, do you learn all that fellow’s books by heart?” was Barney’s disgusted  [disgusted - отвращение] reaction  [reaction - реакция] as he strode  [strode - строде] off.  

“John Foster’s books were all that saved my soul alive the past five years,” averred Valancy.

“Oh, Barney, look at that exquisite  [exquisite - изысканный] filigree of snow in the furrows of that old elm-tree trunk. [trunk - ствол] ”  

When they came out to the lake they changed from snowshoes to skates and skated home.

For a wonder Valancy had learned, when she was a little schoolgirl, [schoolgirl - школьница]  to skate on the pond  [pond - пруд] behind the Deerwood school.

She never had any skates of her own, but some of the other girls had lent her theirs and she seemed to have a natural knack of it.

Uncle Benjamin had once promised her a pair of skates for Christmas, but when Christmas came he had given her rubbers instead.

She had never skated since she grew up, but the old trick came back quickly, and glorious  [glorious - великолепный] were the hours she and Barney spent skimming  [skimming - скольжение] over the white lakes and past the dark islands where the summer cottages  [cottages - коттеджи] were closed and silent.

Tonight they flew down Mistawis before the wind, in an exhilaration  [exhilaration - волнение] that crimsoned Valancy’s cheeks  [cheeks - щеки] under her white tam.

And at the end was her dear little house, on the island of pines, [pines - сосны]  with a coating of snow on its roof, sparkling in the moonlight. [moonlight - лунный свет] 

“Looks exactly like a picture-book, doesn’t it?” said Barney.  

They had a lovely Christmas.

No rush.

No scramble. [scramble - схватка] 

No niggling attempts to make ends meet.

No wild effort to remember whether she hadn’t given the same kind of present to the same person two Christmases before—no mob  [mob - толпа] of last-minute shoppers—no dreary family “reunions” where she sat mute and unimportant—no attacks of “nerves. [nerves - нервы] ”

They decorated  [decorated - украшенный] the Blue Castle with pine  [pine - сосна] boughs, and Valancy made delightful little tinsel stars and hung them up amid  [amid - среди] the greenery.

She cooked a dinner to which Barney did full justice, while Good Luck and Banjo picked the bones.  

“A land that can produce a goose  [goose - гуся] like that is an admirable  [admirable - замечательный] land,” vowed  [vowed - поклялся] Barney.

“Canada forever!”

And they drank to the Union Jack a bottle of dandelion  [dandelion - одуванчик] wine that Cousin Georgiana had given Valancy along with the bedspread.  

“One never knows,” Cousin Georgiana had said solemnly, “when one may need a little stimulant. [stimulant - стимулятор] ”  

Barney had asked Valancy what she wanted for a Christmas present.  

“Something frivolous and unnecessary,” said Valancy, who had got a pair of goloshes last Christmas and two long-sleeved, woolen undervests the year before.

And so on back.  

To her delight, Barney gave her a necklace of pearl  [pearl - жемчуг] beads.

Valancy had wanted a string of milky pearl  [pearl - жемчуг] beads—like congealed moonshine—all her life.

And these were so pretty.

All that worried her was that they were really too good.

They must have cost a great deal—fifteen dollars, at least.

Could Barney afford that?

She didn’t know a thing about his finances. [finances - финансы] 

She had refused to let him buy any of her clothes—she had enough for that, she told him, as long as she would need clothes.

In a round, black jar on the chimney- [chimney - дымоход] piece Barney put money for their household expenses—always enough.

The jar was never empty, though Valancy never caught him replenishing it.

She would wear it and enjoy it.

It was the first pretty thing she had ever had.     

CHAPTER XXXII   New Year.

The old, shabby, [shabby - ветхий]  inglorious outlived  [outlived - пережил] calendar came down.

The new one went up.

January was a month of storms.

It snowed for three weeks on end.

The thermometer  [thermometer - термометр] went miles below zero and stayed there.

But, as Barney and Valancy pointed out to each other, there were no mosquitoes.

And the roar and crackle of their big fire drowned  [drowned - утонул] the howls of the north wind.

Good Luck and Banjo waxed fat  [fat - жирный] and developed resplendent  [resplendent - блестящий] coats of thick, silky fur.

Nip and Tuck had gone.  

“But they’ll come back in spring,” promised Barney.  

There was no monotony. [monotony - однообразие] 

Sometimes they had dramatic little private spats that never even thought of becoming quarrels. [quarrels - ссоры] 

Sometimes Roaring  [Roaring - ревущий] Abel dropped in—for an evening or a whole day—with his old tartan  [tartan - шотландка] cap and his long red beard coated with snow.

He generally brought his fiddle  [fiddle - скрипка] and played for them, to the delight of all except Banjo, who would go temporarily  [temporarily - временно] insane and retreat  [retreat - отступление] under Valancy’s bed.

Sometimes Abel and Barney talked while Valancy made candy for them; sometimes they sat and smoked in silence _à la_

Tennyson and Carlyle, until the Blue Castle reeked and Valancy fled  [fled - бежал] to the open.

Sometimes they played checkers fiercely  [fiercely - яростно] and silently the whole night through.

Sometimes they all ate the russet apples Abel had brought, while the jolly old clock ticked the delightful minutes away.  

Presumably  [Presumably - Предположительно] none of the Stirlings ever thought about her—except Cousin Georgiana, who used to lie awake worrying about poor Doss.

Did she have enough to eat?

Was that dreadful  [dreadful - ужасный] creature good to her?

Was she warm enough at nights?  

Valancy was quite warm at nights.

She used to wake up and revel  [revel - пик] silently in the cosiness of those winter nights on that little island in the frozen lake.

The nights of other winters had been so cold and long.

Valancy hated to wake up in them and think about the bleakness and emptiness  [emptiness - пустота]  [emptiness - пустота] of the day that had passed and the bleakness and emptiness of the day that would come.

Now, she almost counted that night lost on which she didn’t wake up and lie awake for half an hour just being happy, while Barney’s regular breathing went on beside her, and through the open door the smouldering brands in the fireplace  [fireplace - камин] winked at her in the gloom. [gloom - мрак] 

It was very nice to feel a little Lucky cat jump up on your bed in the darkness  [darkness - мрак] and snuggle down at your feet, purring; but Banjo would be sitting dourly by himself out in front of the fire like a brooding demon. [demon - демон] 

At such moments Banjo was anything but canny, but Valancy loved his uncanniness.  

The side of the bed had to be right against the window.

There was no other place for it in the tiny room.

Valancy, lying there, could look out of the window, through the big pine  [pine - сосна] boughs that actually touched it, away up Mistawis, white and lustrous as a pavement  [pavement - мостовая] of pearl, [pearl - жемчужина]  or dark and terrible in the storm.

Sometimes the pine  [pine - сосна] boughs tapped  [tapped - постучал] against the panes with friendly  [friendly - дружелюбно] signals.

Sometimes she heard the little hissing whisper of snow against them right at her side.

Valancy wasted many perfectly good sleeping hours in these delightful communings.

But she could sleep as long in the morning as she wanted to.

Nobody cared.

Barney cooked his own breakfast of bacon and eggs and then shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber till supper time.

Then they had an evening of reading and talk.

They talked about everything in this world and a good many things in other worlds.

They laughed over their own jokes until the Blue Castles re-echoed.  

“You _do_ laugh beautifully,” Barney told her once.

“It makes me want to laugh just to hear you laugh.

There’s a trick about your laugh—as if there were so much more fun back of it that you wouldn’t let out.

Did you laugh like that before you came to Mistawis, Moonlight?”  

“I never laughed at all—really.

I used to giggle foolishly  [foolishly - глупо] when I felt I was expected to.

But now—the laugh just comes.”  

It struck Valancy more than once that Barney himself laughed a great deal oftener than he used to and that his laugh had changed.

It had become wholesome.

She rarely heard the little cynical  [cynical - цинично] note in it now.

Could a man laugh like that who had crimes on his conscience? [conscience - совесть] 

Yet Barney _must_ have done something.

Valancy had indifferently made up her mind as to what he had done.

She concluded he was a defaulting bank cashier. [cashier - кассир] 

She had found in one of Barney’s books an old clipping cut from a Montreal paper in which a vanished, [vanished - исчез]  defaulting cashier  [cashier - кассир] was described.

The description applied to Barney—as well as to half a dozen other men Valancy knew—and from some casual  [casual - случайно] remarks  [remarks - замечания] he had dropped from time to time she concluded he knew Montreal rather well.

Valancy had it all figured out in the back of her mind.

Barney had been in a bank.

He was tempted  [tempted - соблазн] to take some money to speculate— [speculate - спекулировать] meaning, of course, to put it back.

He had got in deeper  [deeper - глубже]  [deeper - глубже] and deeper, until he found there was nothing for it but flight.

It had happened so to scores of men.

He had, Valancy was absolutely certain, never meant to do wrong.

Of course, the name of the man in the clipping was Bernard Craig.

But Valancy had always thought Snaith was an alias.

Not that it mattered.  

Valancy had only one unhappy night that winter.

It came in late March when most of the snow had gone and Nip and Tuck had returned.

Barney had gone off in the afternoon for a long, woodland tramp, [tramp - бродяга]  saying he would be back by dark if all went well.

Soon after he had gone it had begun to snow.

The wind rose and presently  [presently - в настоящее время] Mistawis was in the grip  [grip - хватка] of one of the worst storms of the winter.

It tore up the lake and struck at the little house.

The trees on the island crouched in fear.

Valancy spent the night huddled on the rug  [rug - ковер] before the fire, her face buried in her hands, when she was not vainly peering from the oriel in a futile effort to see through the furious  [furious - яростный] smoke of wind and snow that had once been blue-dimpled Mistawis.

Where was Barney?

Lost on the merciless lakes?

Sinking exhausted in the drifts of the pathless woods?

Valancy died a hundred deaths that night and paid in full for all the happiness of her Blue Castle.

When morning came the storm broke and cleared; the sun shone gloriously over Mistawis; and at noon  [noon - полдень] Barney came home.

Valancy saw him from the oriel as he came around a wooded  [wooded - лесной] point, slender and black against the glistening white world.

She did not run to meet him.

Something happened to her knees and she dropped down on Banjo’s chair.

Luckily Banjo got out from under in time, his whiskers bristling with indignation.

Barney found her there, her head buried in her hands.  

“Barney, I thought you were dead,” she whispered. [whispered - шептал]   

Barney hooted.  

“After two years of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like this could get me?

I spent the night in that old lumber shanty over by Muskoka.

A bit cold but snug enough.

Little goose! [goose - гусь] 

Your eyes look like burnt holes in a blanket. [blanket - одеяло] 

Did you sit up here all night worrying over an old woodsman  [woodsman - лесник] like me?”  

“Yes,” said Valancy.

“I—couldn’t help it.

The storm seemed so wild.

Anybody might have been lost in it.

When—I saw you—come round the point—there—something happened to me.

I don’t know what.

It was as if I had died and come back to life.

I can’t describe it any other way.”     

CHAPTER XXXIII   Spring.

Mistawis black and sullen for a week or two, then flaming in sapphire and turquoise, lilac and rose again, laughing through the oriel, caressing its amethyst islands, rippling under winds soft as silk.

Frogs, little green wizards of swamp and pool, singing everywhere in the long twilights and long into the nights; islands fairy-like in a green haze; the evanescent beauty of wild young trees in early leaf; frost-like loveliness  [loveliness - прелесть] of the new foliage of juniper-trees; the woods putting on a fashion of spring flowers, dainty, spiritual things akin  [akin - родственный] to the soul of the wilderness; [wilderness - пустыня]  red mist  [mist - туман] on the maples; willows decked out with glossy silver pussies; all the forgotten violets of Mistawis blooming  [blooming - цветение] again; lure  [lure - приманка] of April moons.  

“Think how many thousands of springs have been here on Mistawis—and all of them beautiful,” said Valancy.

“Oh, Barney, look at that wild plum! [plum - слива] 

The fingers of wood pixies must have woven  [woven - сотканный] it, for nothing like it ever came from an earthly loom.

I vow  [vow - клятва] the tree is conscious of its loveliness. [loveliness - красота] 

It is bridling before our very eyes—as if its beauty were not the most ephemeral thing in the woods, as it is the rarest and most exceeding, for today it is and tomorrow it is not.

Every south wind purring through the boughs will winnow away a shower of slender petals.

But what matter?

Today it is queen of the wild places and it is always today in the woods.’”  

“I’m sure you feel much better since you’ve got that out of your system,” said Barney heartlessly.  

“Here’s a patch  [patch - патч] of dandelions, [dandelions - одуванчики] ” said Valancy, unsubdued.

“Dandelions  [Dandelions - Одуванчики] shouldn’t grow in the woods, though.

They haven’t any sense of the fitness of things at all.

They are too cheerful and self-satisfied.

They haven’t any of the mystery and reserve of the real wood-flowers.”  

“In short, they’ve no secrets,” said Barney.

“But wait a bit.

The woods will have their own way even with those obvious dandelions. [dandelions - одуванчики] 

In a little while all that obtrusive yellowness and complacency will be gone and we’ll find here misty, phantom-like globes  [globes - глобусы] hovering  [hovering - парящие] over those long grasses in full harmony  [harmony - гармония] with the traditions of the forest.”  

“That sounds John Fosterish,” teased  [teased - дразнили] Valancy.  

“What have I done that deserved a slam like that?” complained Barney.  

One of the earliest signs of spring was the renaissance of Lady Jane.

Barney put her on roads that no other car would look at, and they went through Deerwood in mud to the axles.

They passed several Stirlings, who groaned and reflected that now spring was come they would encounter  [encounter - встреча] that shameless  [shameless - бесстыдные] pair everywhere.

There sat her mother and Cousin Stickles drearily, grimly knitting.

Baffling and inhuman  [inhuman - нечеловеческий] as ever.

If they had looked the least bit lonesome Valancy would have gone in.

But they did not.

Valancy would not disturb  [disturb - беспокоить] them for worlds.     

CHAPTER XXXIV   Valancy had two wonderful moments that spring.  

One day, coming home through the woods, with her arms full of trailing  [trailing - плетущийся] arbutus and creeping spruce, she met a man who she knew must be Allan Tierney.

Allan Tierney, the celebrated  [celebrated - прославленный] painter of beautiful women.

He lived in New York in winter, but he owned an island cottage  [cottage - коттеджный] at the northern end of Mistawis to which he always came the minute the ice was out of the lake.

He was reputed  [reputed - известный] to be a lonely, eccentric  [eccentric - чудаковатый] man.

He never flattered  [flattered - польщенный] his sitters.

There was no need  [need - нужда] to, for he would not paint any one who required flattery. [flattery - лесть] 

To be painted by Allan Tierney was all the _cachet_ of beauty a woman could desire. [desire - желание] 

Valancy had heard so much about him that she couldn’t help turning her head back over her shoulder for another shy, curious  [curious - любопытный] look at him.

A shaft of pale spring sunlight fell through a great pine  [pine - сосна] athwart her bare  [bare - голый] black head and her slanted eyes.

She wore a pale green sweater and had bound  [bound - связанный] a fillet of linnæa vine about her hair.

“Who?” Valancy was surprised but indifferent. [indifferent - безразличный] 

She began filling a basket  [basket - корзина] with arbutus.  

“Allan Tierney.

He wants to paint you, Moonlight.”  

“Me!”

Valancy dropped her basket  [basket - корзина] and her arbutus.

“You’re laughing at me, Barney.”  

“I’m not.

That’s what Tierney came for.

To ask my permission to paint my wife—as the Spirit of Muskoka, or something like that.”  

“But—but—” stammered  [stammered - заикался] Valancy, “Allan Tierney never paints any but—any but——”  “Beautiful women,” finished Barney.

“Conceded. [Conceded - уступал] 

Q. E. D., Mistress Barney Snaith is a beautiful woman.”  

“Nonsense, [Nonsense - ерунда] ” said Valancy, stooping to retrieve  [retrieve - извлекал] her arbutus.

“You _know_

that’s nonsense, [nonsense - ерунда]  Barney.

I know I’m a heap  [heap - куча] better-looking than I was a year ago, but I’m not beautiful.”  

“Allan Tierney never makes a mistake,” said Barney.

“You forget, Moonlight, that there are different kinds of beauty.

Your imagination is obsessed  [obsessed - одержимый] by the very obvious type of your cousin Olive.

Oh, I’ve seen her—she’s a stunner—but you’d never catch Allan Tierney wanting to paint her.

In the horrible but expressive  [expressive - выразительный] slang  [slang - сленг] phrase, she keeps all her goods  [goods - добро] in the shop-window.

But in your subconscious mind you have a conviction  [conviction - убеждение] that nobody can be beautiful who doesn’t look like Olive.

Also, you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was not allowed to shine through it.

Tierney said something about the curve of your cheek  [cheek - щека] as you looked back over your shoulder.

“Well, I don’t want to be painted,” said Valancy.

“I hope you told him that.”  

“I couldn’t tell him that.

I didn’t know what _you_ wanted.

But I told him _

I_ didn’t want my wife painted—hung up in a salon  [salon - салон] for the mob  [mob - толпа] to stare at.

Belonging to another man.

For of course I couldn’t buy the picture.

So even if you had wanted to be painted, Moonlight, your tyrannous husband would not have permitted it.

Tierney was a bit squiffy.

He isn’t used to being turned down like that.

His requests are almost like royalty’ [royalty - королевство] s.”  

“But we are outlaws,” laughed Valancy.

“We bow  [bow - лук] to no decrees—we acknowledge no sovereignty. [sovereignty - суверенитет] ”  

In her heart she thought unashamedly: [unashamedly - нагло]   “I wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted to paint me.

_

Me_!

Little-old-maid-Valancy-Stirling-that-was.”  

Her second wonder-moment came one evening in May.

She realised that Barney actually liked her.

She had always hoped he did, but sometimes she had a little, disagreeable, [disagreeable - неприятный]  haunting  [haunting - преследующий] dread that he was just kind and nice and chummy out of pity; [pity - жалость]  knowing that she hadn’t long to live and determined she should have a good time as long as she did live; but away back in his mind rather looking forward to freedom again, with no intrusive woman creature in his island fastness and no chattering thing beside him in his woodland prowls.

She knew he could never love her.

She did not even want him to.

If he loved her he would be unhappy when she died—Valancy never flinched from the plain word.

No “passing away” for her.

And she did not want him to be the least unhappy.

But neither did she want him to be glad—or relieved. [relieved - облегченный] 

She wanted him to like her and miss her as a good chum.

But she had never been sure until this night that he did.  

They had walked over the hills in the sunset.

They had the delight of discovering a virgin spring in a ferny hollow  [hollow - полый] and had drunk together from it out of a birch-bark cup; they had come to an old tumble-down rail  [rail - рельс] fence and sat on it for a long time.

They didn’t talk much, but Valancy had a curious  [curious - любопытный] sense of _oneness_.

She knew that she couldn’t have felt that if he hadn’t liked her.  

“You nice little thing,” said Barney suddenly.

“Oh, you nice little thing!

Sometimes I feel you’re too nice to be real—that I’m just dreaming you.”  

“Why can’t I die now—this very minute—when I am so happy!” thought Valancy.  

Well, it couldn’t be so very long now.

Somehow, Valancy had always felt she would live out the year Dr. Trent had allotted.

She had not been careful—she had never tried to be.

But, somehow, she had always counted on living out her year.

She had not let herself think about it at all.

But now, sitting here beside Barney, with her hand in his, a sudden realisation came to her.

She had not had a heart attack for a long while—two months at least.

The last one she had had was two or three nights before Barney was out in the storm.

Since then she had not remembered she had a heart.

Well, no doubt, it betokened the nearness of the end.

Nature had given up the struggle.

There would be no more pain.  

“I’m afraid heaven will be very dull  [dull - скучный] after this past year,” thought Valancy.

“But perhaps one will not remember.

Would that be—nice?

No, no.

I don’t want to forget Barney.

I’d rather be miserable  [miserable - жалкий] in heaven remembering him than happy forgetting him.

And I’ll always remember through all eternity—that he really, _really_ liked me.”     

CHAPTER XXXV   

Thirty seconds can be very long sometimes.

In thirty seconds life changed wholly  [wholly - полностью] for Barney and Valancy Snaith.  

They had gone around the lake one June evening in their disappearing propeller, fished for an hour in a little creek, [creek - ручей]  left their boat there, and walked up through the woods to Port Lawrence two miles away.

Valancy prowled  [prowled - бродил] a bit in the shops and got herself a new pair of sensible  [sensible - разумный] shoes.

Her old pair had suddenly and completely given out, and this evening she had been compelled  [compelled - вынужденный] to put on the little fancy pair of patent- [patent - патент] leather with rather high, slender heels, which she had bought in a fit  [fit - подгонка] of folly  [folly - глупость] one day in the winter because of their beauty and because she wanted to make one foolish, extravagant purchase  [purchase - покупка] in her life.

She sometimes put them on of an evening in the Blue Castle, but this was the first time she had worn them outside.

She had not found it any too easy walking up through the woods in them, and Barney guyed her unmercifully about them.

But in spite  [spite - назло] of the inconvenience, Valancy secretly rather liked the look of her trim ankles and high instep above those pretty, foolish shoes and did not change them in the shop as she might have done.  

The sun was hanging low above the pines  [pines - сосны] when they left Port Lawrence.

To the north of it the woods closed around the town quite suddenly.

Valancy always had a sense of stepping from one world to another—from reality to fairyland—when she went out of Port Lawrence and in a twinkling found it shut off behind her by the armies of the pines. [pines - сосны]   

A mile and a half from Port Lawrence there was a small railroad station with a little station-house which at this hour of the day was deserted, [deserted - пустынный]  since no local train was due.

Not a soul was in sight when Barney and Valancy emerged from the woods.

Off to the left a sudden curve in the track hid it from view, but over the tree-tops beyond, the long plume of smoke betokened the approach of a through train.

The rails  [rails - рельсы] were vibrating  [vibrating - вибрирующий] to its thunder as Barney stepped across the switch.

She could never tell how it happened.

The ensuing  [ensuing - последующий] thirty seconds always seemed in her recollection  [recollection - воспоминание] like a chaotic  [chaotic - хаотический] nightmare  [nightmare - кошмар] in which she endured  [endured - пережитый] the agony  [agony - агония] of a thousand lifetimes. [lifetimes - жизни]   

The heel of her pretty, foolish shoe caught in a crevice of the switch.

She could not pull it loose.  

“Barney—Barney!”

she called in alarm.  

Barney turned—saw her predicament— [predicament - затруднительное положение] saw her ashen face—dashed  [dashed - разбитый] back.

He tried to pull her clear—he tried to wrench  [wrench - гаечный ключ] her foot from the prisoning hold.

In vain.

In a moment the train would sweep  [sweep - разметать] around the curve—would be on them.  

“Go—go—quick—you’ll be killed, Barney!” shrieked Valancy, trying to push him away.  

Barney dropped on his knees, ghost-white, frantically  [frantically - лихорадочно] tearing at her shoe-lace. [lace - кружево] 

The knot  [knot - узел] defied  [defied - бросил вызов] his trembling fingers.

Her mind was full of the hideous thought that Barney was going to be killed.

She had no thought for her own danger.  

“Barney—go—go—for God’s sake— [sake - саке] go!”  

“Never!” muttered  [muttered - бормотал] Barney between his set teeth.

He gave one mad wrench at the lace. [lace - кружево] 

As the train thundered around the curve he sprang up and caught Valancy—dragging her clear, leaving the shoe behind her.

The wind from the train as it swept  [swept - пронесло] by turned to icy  [icy - ледяной] cold the streaming perspiration  [perspiration - пот] on his face.  

“Thank God!”

he breathed.  

For a moment they stood stupidly staring at each other, two white, shaken, [shaken - потрясенный]  wild-eyed creatures.

Then they stumbled  [stumbled - спотыкался] over to the little seat at the end of the station-house and dropped on it.

Barney buried his face in his hands and said not a word.

Valancy sat, staring straight ahead of her with unseeing eyes at the great pine woods, the stumps of the clearing, the long, gleaming rails. [rails - рельсы] 

There was only one thought in her dazed mind—a thought that seemed to burn it as a shaving of fire might burn her body.  

Dr. Trent had told her over a year ago that she had a serious form of heart-disease—that any excitement might be fatal. [fatal - смертельный]   

If that were so, why was she not dead now?

This very minute?

She had just experienced as much and as terrible excitement as most people experience in a lifetime, [lifetime - на всю жизнь]  crowded into that endless  [endless - бесконечный] thirty seconds.

Yet she had not died of it.

She was not an iota the worse for it.

A little wobbly at the knees, as any one would have been; a quicker heart-beat, [beat - бит]  as any one would have; nothing more.  

Why!  _Was it possible Dr. Trent had made a mistake?_  

Valancy shivered as if a cold wind had suddenly chilled  [chilled - охлажденный] her to the soul.

She looked at Barney, hunched up beside her.

His silence was very eloquent. [eloquent - красноречивый] 

Had the same thought occurred to him?

Valancy turned sick before the horror of it.

It could not be.

It would be too cruel—too devilish.

Dr. Trent _couldn’t_ have made a mistake.

Impossible.

He was one of the best heart specialists in Ontario.

She was foolish—unnerved by the recent horror.

She remembered some of the hideous spasms of pain she had had.

There must be something serious the matter with her heart to account for them.  

But she had not had any for nearly three months.  

Why?  Presently  [Presently - В настоящее время] Barney bestirred himself.

He stood up, without looking at Valancy, and said casually: [casually - небрежно]   “I suppose we’d better be hiking back.

Sun’s getting low.

Are you good for the rest of the road?”  

“I think so,” said Valancy miserably. [miserably - жалко]   

Barney went across the clearing and picked up the parcel he had dropped—the parcel containing her new shoes.

He brought it to her and let her take out the shoes and put them on without any assistance, [assistance - помощь]  while he stood with his back to her and looked out over the pines. [pines - сосны]   

They walked in silence down the shadowy trail to the lake.

In silence Barney steered  [steered - управляемые] his boat into the sunset miracle  [miracle - чудо] that was Mistawis.

In silence they went around feathery headlands and across coral bays  [bays - бухты] and silver rivers where canoes  [canoes - каноэ] were slipping up and down in the afterglow.

In silence they went past cottages  [cottages - коттеджи] echoing with music and laughter.

In silence drew up at the landing- [landing - приземление] place below the Blue Castle.  

Valancy went up the rock steps and into the house.

Valancy would have given her year of happiness to have been able honestly to answer “Yes.”  

“No,” she said flatly.  

Barney went into Bluebeard’s Chamber and shut the door.

She heard him pacing  [pacing - темп] up and down—up and down.

He had never paced  [paced - шаг] like that before.  

And an hour ago—only an hour ago—she had been so happy!     

CHAPTER XXXVI   

Finally Valancy went to bed.

Before she went she re-read Dr. Trent’s letter.

It comforted her a little.

So positive.

So assured.

The writing so black and steady.

Not the writing of a man who didn’t know what he was writing about.

But she could not sleep.

She pretended to be asleep when Barney came in.

Barney pretended to go to sleep.

But Valancy knew perfectly well he wasn’t sleeping any more than she was.

She knew he was lying there, staring through the darkness. [darkness - тьма] 

Thinking of what?

Trying to face—what?  Valancy, who had spent so many happy wakeful hours of night lying by that window, now paid the price of them all in this one night of misery. [misery - страдание] 

A horrible, portentous fact was slowly looming  [looming - вырисовывающийся] out before her from the nebula of surmise and fear.

She could not shut her eyes to it—push it away—ignore it.  

There could be nothing seriously wrong with her heart, no matter what Dr. Trent had said.

If there had been, those thirty seconds would have killed her.

It was no use to recall Dr. Trent’s letter and reputation.

The greatest specialists made mistakes sometimes.

Dr. Trent had made one.  

Towards morning Valancy fell into a fitful dose  [dose - доза] with ridiculous  [ridiculous - нелепый] dreams.

One of them was of Barney taunting her with having tricked  [tricked - обманутый] him.

In her dream she lost her temper and struck him violently on the head with her rolling-pin. [pin - булавка] 

He proved to be made of glass and shivered into splinters all over the floor.

She woke with a cry of horror—a gasp  [gasp - удушье] of relief— [relief - облегчение] a short laugh over the absurdity of her dream—a miserable  [miserable - жалкое] sickening recollection  [recollection - воспоминание] of what had happened.  

Barney was gone.

Valancy knew, as people sometimes know things—inescapably, without being told—that he was not in the house or in Bluebeard’s Chamber either.

There was a curious  [curious - любопытный] silence in the living- [living - живой] room.

A silence with something uncanny about it.

The old clock had stopped.

So Barney had betaken himself to the wilds.

He would not return till night—perhaps not even then.

He must be angry with her.

That furious  [furious - яростный] silence of his must mean anger—cold, deep, [deep - глубокий]  justifiable resentment. [resentment - обида] 

Well, Valancy knew what she must do first.

She was not suffering very keenly  [keenly - остро] now.

Yet the curious  [curious - любопытный] numbness that pervaded her being was in a way worse than pain.

It was as if something in her had died.

She forced  [forced - вынужденный] herself to cook and eat a little breakfast.

Mechanically  [Mechanically - Механически] she put the Blue Castle in perfect order.

Then she put on her hat and coat, locked the door and hid the key in the hollow  [hollow - полый] of the old pine  [pine - сосна] and crossed to the mainland  [mainland - материк] in the motor boat.

She was going into Deerwood to see Dr. Trent.

She must _know_.     

CHAPTER XXXVII   Dr. Trent looked at her blankly  [blankly - тупо] and fumbled among his recollections. [recollections - воспоминания]   

“Er—Miss—Miss—”  “Mrs. Snaith,” said Valancy quietly.

“I was Miss Valancy Stirling when I came to you last May—over a year ago.

I wanted to consult  [consult - советоваться] you about my heart.”  

Dr. Trent’s face cleared.  

“Oh, of course.

I remember now.

I’m really not to blame for not knowing you.

You’ve changed—splendidly.

And married.

Well, well, it has agreed with you.

You don’t look much like an invalid  [invalid - неверный] now, hey?

I remember that day.

I was badly upset.

Hearing about poor Ned bowled me over.

But Ned’s as good as new and you, too, evidently. [evidently - очевидно] 

I told you so, you know—told you there was nothing to worry over.”  

Valancy looked at him.  

“I couldn’t have told you that!”  

Valancy took his letter from her bag and handed it to him.  

“Miss Valancy Stirling,” he read.

“Yes—yes.

Of course I wrote you—on the train—that night.

But I _told_

you there was nothing serious——”  “Read your letter,” insisted Valancy.  

Dr. Trent took it out—unfolded  [unfolded - развернулся] it—glanced over it.

A dismayed look came into his face.

He jumped to his feet and strode  [strode - шагал] agitatedly about the room.  

“Good heavens!

This is the letter I meant for old Miss Jane Sterling.

From Port Lawrence.

She was here that day, too.

I sent you the wrong letter.

What unpardonable carelessness!

But I was beside myself that night.

My God, and you believed that—you believed—but you didn’t—you went to another doctor——”  Valancy stood up, turned round, looked foolishly  [foolishly - глупо] about her and sat down again.  

“I believed it,” she said faintly. [faintly - слабо] 

“I didn’t go to any other doctor.

I—I—it would take too long to explain.

But I believed I was going to die soon.”  

Dr. Trent halted before her.  

“I can never forgive myself.

What a year you must have had!

But you don’t look—I can’t understand!”  

“Never mind,” said Valancy dully.

“And so there’s nothing the matter with my heart?”  

“Well, nothing serious.

You had what is called pseudo-angina.

It’s never fatal— [fatal - фатально] passes away completely with proper treatment.

Or sometimes with a shock of joy.

Have you been troubled much with it?”  

“Not at all since March,” answered Valancy.

She remembered the marvellous feeling of re-creation  [creation - творение] she had had when she saw Barney coming home safe after the storm.

Had that “shock of joy” cured  [cured - вылечил] her?  

“Then likely you’re all right.

I told you what to do in the letter you should have got.

_

And_ of course I supposed you’d go to another doctor.

Child, why didn’t you?”  “I didn’t want anybody to know.”  

“Idiot, [Idiot - Идиот] ” said Dr. Trent bluntly. [bluntly - прямо] 

“I can’t understand such folly. [folly - глупость] 

And poor old Miss Sterling.

She must have got your letter—telling her there was nothing serious the matter.

Well, well, it couldn’t have made any difference.

Her case was hopeless.

Nothing that she could have done or left undone could have made any difference.

I was surprised she lived as long as she did—two months.

She was here that day—not long before you.

I hated to tell her the truth.

You think I’m a blunt old curmudgeon—and my letters _are_ blunt enough.

I can’t soften  [soften - смягчил] things.

But I’m a snivelling coward  [coward - трус] when it comes to telling a woman face to face that she’s got to die soon.

I told her I’d look up some features of the case I wasn’t quite sure of and let her know next day.

But you got her letter—look here, ‘Dear Miss S-t-_e_-r-l-i-n-g.’”  “Yes.

I noticed that.

But I thought it a mistake.

I didn’t know there were any Sterlings in Port Lawrence.”  

“She was the only one.

A lonely old soul.

Lived by herself with only a little home girl.

She died two months after she was here—died in her sleep.

My mistake couldn’t have made any difference to her.

But you!

I can’t forgive myself for inflicting  [inflicting - причинил] a year’s misery  [misery - страдание] on you.

It’s time I retired, all right, when I do things like that—even if my son was supposed to be fatally injured.

Can you ever forgive me?”  

A year of misery! [misery - страдание] 

Valancy smiled a tortured smile as she thought of all the happiness Dr. Trent’s mistake had bought her.

But she was paying for it now—

oh, she was paying.

If to feel was to live she was living with a vengeance.  

She let Dr. Trent examine her and answered all his questions.

Anybody would have thought, from her hopeless eyes and woebegone face, that he had given her a sentence of death instead of life.

Snaith? Snaith?

Who the devil  [devil - черт] had she married?

He had never heard of Snaiths in Deerwood.

And she had been such a sallow, faded, [faded - поблек]  little old maid.

Gad, but marriage _had_ made a difference in her, anyhow, whoever Snaith was.

Snaith?

Dr. Trent remembered.

That rapscallion “up back!”

Had Valancy Stirling married _him_?

And her clan  [clan - клан] had let her!

Well, probably that solved the mystery.

She had married in haste  [haste - поспешность] and repented at leisure, and that was why she wasn’t overjoyed at learning she was a good insurance prospect, [prospect - перспектива]  after all.

Married!

To God knew whom!

Or what!

Jail-bird?

Defaulter?

Fugitive from justice?

It must be pretty bad if she had looked to death as a release, poor girl.

But why were women such fools? [fools - дураков] 

Dr. Trent dismissed  [dismissed - уволили] Valancy from his mind, though to the day of his death he was ashamed of putting those letters into the wrong envelopes. [envelopes - конверты]      

CHAPTER XXXVIII   Valancy walked quickly through the back streets and through Lover’s Lane.

She did not want to meet any one she knew.

She didn’t want to meet even people she didn’t know.

She hated to be seen.

Her mind was so confused, so torn, so messy.

She felt that her appearance must be the same.

She drew a sobbing  [sobbing - рыдания] breath of relief  [relief - облегчение] as she left the village behind and found herself on the “up back” road.

There was little fear of meeting any one she knew here.

The cars that fled  [fled - бежали] by her with raucous shrieks were filled with strangers.

On [O - О] e of them was packed with young people who whirled past her singing uproariously:  “My wife has the fever, [fever - лихорадка]  [fever - лихорадка]  O then, My wife has the fever,

She had made a covenant with death and death had cheated  [cheated - обманутый] her.

Now life stood mocking her.

She had trapped Barney.

Trapped him into marrying her.

And divorce  [divorce - развод] was so hard to get in Ontario.

So expensive.

And Barney was poor.  

With life, fear had come back into her heart.

Sickening fear.

Fear of what Barney would think.

Would say.

Fear of the future that must be lived without him.

Fear of her insulted, [insulted - обиженный]  repudiated clan. [clan - родовой]   

She had had one draught from a divine  [divine - божественный] cup and now it was dashed  [dashed - накатанный] from her lips.

With no kind, friendly  [friendly - дружеский] death to rescue her.

She must go on living  [living - живой] and longing for it.

Everything was spoiled, [spoiled - испорченный]  smirched, defaced.

Even that year in the Blue Castle.

Even her unashamed love for Barney.

It had been beautiful because death waited.

Now it was only sordid because death was gone.

How could any one bear an unbearable  [unbearable - невыносимый] thing?  

She must go back and tell him.

Make him believe she had not meant to trick  [trick - хитрость] him—she _must_ make him believe that.

She must say good-bye to her Blue Castle and return to the brick  [brick - кирпич] house on Elm Street.

Back to everything she had thought left behind forever.

The old bondage—the old fears.

But that did not matter.

All that mattered now was that Barney must somehow be made to believe she had not consciously  [consciously - сознательно] tricked  [tricked - обманутый] him.  

A wonderful car.

A purple car.

Not a dark, royal purple but a blatant, screaming purple.

It shone like a mirror and its interior plainly  [plainly - прямо] indicated the car caste of Vere de Vere.

On the driver’s seat sat a haughty chauffeur in livery.

And in the tonneau sat a man who opened the door and bounced  [bounced - подпрыгнул] out nimbly as Valancy came down the path to the landing- [landing - приземлился] place.

He stood under the pines  [pines - сосны] waiting for her and Valancy took in every detail of him.  

A stout, short, pudgy man, with a broad, rubicund, good-humoured face—a clean-shaven face, though an unparalysed little imp  [imp - черенок] at the back of Valancy’s paralysed mind suggested the thought, “Such a face should have a fringe of white whisker around it.”

Old-fashioned, steel-rimmed spectacles  [spectacles - очки] on prominent  [prominent - выдающийся] blue eyes.

A pursey mouth; a little round, knobby nose.

Where—where—where, groped Valancy, had she seen that face before?

It seemed as familiar to her as her own.  

The stranger wore a green hat and a light fawn overcoat  [overcoat - шинель] over a suit of a loud check pattern.

His tie was a brilliant green of lighter shade; on the plump  [plump - пухлый] hand he outstretched to intercept Valancy an enormous diamond winked at her.

But he had a pleasant, fatherly smile, and in his hearty, unmodulated voice was a ring of something that attracted her.  

“Can you tell me, Miss, if that house yonder belongs to a Mr. Redfern?

And if so, how can I get to it?”  

Redfern!

A vision of bottles seemed to dance before Valancy’s eyes—long bottles of bitters—round bottles of hair tonic—square bottles of liniment—short, corpulent little bottles of purple pills— [pills - таблетки] and all of them bearing that very prosperous, beaming moon-face and steel-rimmed spectacles  [spectacles - очки] on the label. [label - этикетка]   

Dr. Redfern!  

“No,” said Valancy faintly. [faintly - слабо] 

“No—that house belongs to Mr. Snaith.”  

Dr. Redfern nodded. [nodded - кивал]   

“Yes, I understand Bernie’s been calling himself Snaith.

Well, it’s his middle name—was his poor mother’s.

Bernard Snaith Redfern—that’s him.

And now, Miss, you can tell me how to get over to that island?

Nobody seems to be home there.

I’ve done some waving and yelling. [yelling - орать] 

Raised nothing but a couple of crows.

Guess Bernie’s out for the day.”  

“He was away when I left this morning,” said Valancy.

“I suppose he hasn’t come home yet.”  

She spoke flatly and tonelessly.

This last shock had temporarily  [temporarily - временно] bereft her of whatever little power of reasoning  [reasoning - рассуждение] had been left her by Dr. Trent’s revelation. [revelation - откровение] 

In the back of her mind the aforesaid little imp  [imp - черенок] was jeeringly repeating a silly old proverb, “It never rains but it pours.”

But she was not trying to think.

What was the use?  

Dr. Redfern was gazing at her in perplexity.  

“When you left this morning?

Do you live—over there?”  

He waved his diamond at the Blue Castle.  

“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly.

“I’m his wife.”  

Dr. Redfern took out a yellow silk handkerchief, removed his hat and mopped his brow.

He was very bald, and Valancy’s imp  [imp - черенок] whispered, [whispered - шептал]  “Why be bald?

Why lose your manly beauty?

Try Redfern’s Hair Vigor.

It keeps you young.”  

“Excuse me,” said Dr. Redfern.

“This is a bit of a shock.”  

“Shocks seem to be in the air this morning.”

The imp  [imp - черенок] said this out loud before Valancy could prevent it.  

“I didn’t know Bernie was—married.

I didn’t think he _would_ have got married without telling his old dad.”  Were Dr. Redfern’s eyes misty?

Amid  [Amid - Среди] her own dull  [dull - унылых] ache of misery  [misery - страданий] and fear and dread, Valancy felt a pang of pity  [pity - жалости] for him.  

“Don’t blame him,” she said hurriedly.

“It—it wasn’t his fault.

It—was all my doing.”  

“You didn’t ask him to marry you, I suppose,” twinkled Dr. Redfern.

“He might have let me know.

I’d have got acquainted with my daughter-in-law before this if he had.

But I’m glad to meet you now, my dear—very glad.

You look like a sensible  [sensible - разумного] young woman.

I used to sorter fear  [fear - страха] Barney’d pick out some pretty bit of fluff just because she was good-looking.

They were all after him, of course.

Wanted his money?

Eh?

Didn’t like the pills  [pills - таблетки] and the bitters but liked the dollars.

Eh? Wanted to dip  [dip - окунают] their pretty little fingers in old Doc’s millions.

“Millions,” said Dr. Redfern complacently.

“And Bernie chucks them for—that.”

Again he shook the diamond contemptuously at the Blue Castle.

“Wouldn’t you think he’d have more sense?

And all on account of a white bit of a girl.

He must have got over _that_ feeling, anyhow, since he’s married.

You must persuade him to come back to civilisation.

All nonsense  [nonsense - бред] wasting his life like this.

Ain’t you going to take me over to your house, my dear? [dear - дорогой] 

I suppose you’ve some way of getting there.”  

“Of course,” said Valancy stupidly.

She led the way down to the little cove where the disappearing propeller boat was snuggled.  

“Does your—your man want to come, too?”  

“Who?

Henry.

Not he.

Look at him sitting there disapproving. [disapproving - неодобрительный] 

Disapproves of the whole expedition. [expedition - экспедиция] 

The trail up from the road nearly gave him a conniption.

Well, it _was_ a devilish road to put a car on.

Whose old bus is that up there?”  

“Barney’s.”  “Good Lord!

Does Bernie Redfern ride in a thing like that?

It looks like the great-great-grand-mother of all the Fords.”  

“It isn’t a Ford.

It’s a Grey Slosson,” said Valancy spiritedly.

For some occult reason, Dr. Redfern’s good-humoured ridicule of dear old Lady Jane stung her to life.

A life that was all pain but still _life_.

Better than the horrible half-dead-and-half-aliveness of the past few minutes—or years.

She waved Dr. Redfern curtly into the boat and took him over to the Blue Castle.

The key was still in the old pine— [pine - сосна] the house still silent and deserted.

Valancy took the doctor through the living- [living - живой] room to the western  [western - западный] verandah. [verandah - веранда] 

She must at least be out where there was air.

It was still sunny, but in the southwest a great thundercloud, with white crests and gorges  [gorges - ущелья] of purple shadow, was slowly rising over Mistawis.

The doctor dropped with a gasp  [gasp - вздох] on a rustic chair and mopped his brow again.  

“Warm, eh?

Lord, what a view!

Wonder if it would soften  [soften - смягчить] Henry if he could see it.”  “Have you had dinner?” asked Valancy.  

“Yes, my dear— [dear - дорогой] had it before we left Port Lawrence.

Didn’t know what sort of wild hermit’s hollow  [hollow - полый] we were coming to, you see.

Hadn’t any idea I was going to find a nice little daughter-in-law here all ready to toss  [toss - швырять] me up a meal.

Cats, eh?

Puss, puss!

See that.

Cats love me.

Bernie was always fond  [fond - любить] of cats!

It’s about the only thing he took from me.

He’s his poor mother’s boy.”  

She had remained standing by the steps, but Dr. Redfern waved her to the swing  [swing - качели] seat.  

“Sit down, dear.

Never stand when you can sit.

I want to get a good look at Barney’s wife.

Well, well, I like your face.

No beauty—you don’t mind my saying that—you’ve sense  [sense - чувство] enough to know it, I reckon. [reckon - рассчитываться] 

Sit down.”  

Valancy sat down.

To be obliged  [obliged - обязан] to sit still when mental agony  [agony - агония] urges  [urges - побуждения] us to stride  [stride - шаг] up and down is the refinement of torture. [torture - пытка] 

Every nerve  [nerve - нерв] in her being was crying out to be alone—to be hidden.

But she had to sit and listen to Dr. Redfern, who didn’t mind talking at all.  

“When do you think Bernie will be back?”  

“I don’t know—not before night probably.”  

“Where did he go?”  

“I don’t know that either.

Likely to the woods—up back.”  

“So he doesn’t tell you his comings and goings, either?

Bernie was always a secretive young devil. [devil - дьявол] 

Never understood him.

Just like his poor mother.

But I thought a lot of him.

It hurt me when he disappeared as he did.

Eleven years ago.

I haven’t seen my boy for eleven years.”  

“Eleven years.”

Valancy was surprised.

“It’s only six since he came here.”  

“Oh, he was in the Klondike before that—and all over the world.

He used to drop me a line now and then—never give any clue to where he was but just a line to say he was all right.

I s’pose he’s told you all about it.”  

“No.

I know nothing of his past life,” said Valancy with sudden eagerness.

She wanted to know—she must know now.

It hadn’t mattered before.

Now she must know all.

And she could never hear it from Barney.

She might never even see him again.

If she did, it would not be to talk of his past.  

“What happened?

Why did he leave his home?

Tell me.

Tell me.”  

“Well, it ain’t much of a story.

Just a young fool  [fool - дурак] gone mad because of a quarrel  [quarrel - ссора] with his girl.

Only Bernie was a stubborn fool. [fool - дурак] 

Always stubborn.

You never could make that boy do anything he didn’t want to do.

From the day he was born.

Yet he was always a quiet, gentle little chap, [chap - парень]  too.

Good as gold.

His poor mother died when he was only two years old.

I’d just begun to make money with my Hair Vigor.

I’d dreamed the formula  [formula - формула] for it, you see.

Some dream that.

Wanted me to buy a paper for him—or back him in publishing what he called a ‘real, worthwhile, [worthwhile - стоящее]  honest-to-goodness  [goodness - добро] Canadian Magazine.’

I s’pose I’d have done it—I always did what he wanted me to do.

Wasn’t he all I had to live for?

I wanted him to be happy.

And he never was happy.

Can you believe it?

Not that he said so.

But I’d always a feeling that he wasn’t happy.

Everything he wanted—all the money he could spend—his own bank account—travel—seeing the world—but he wasn’t happy.

Not till he fell in love with Ethel Traverse.

Then he was happy for a little while.”  

The cloud had reached the sun and a great, chill, [chill - холод]  purple shadow came swiftly  [swiftly - стремительно] over Mistawis.

It touched the Blue Castle—rolled  [rolled - катился] over it.

Valancy shivered.  

“Yes,” she said, with painful eagerness, though every word was cutting her to the heart.

“What—was—she—like?”  

“Prettiest girl in Montreal,” said Dr. Redfern.

“Oh, she was a looker, all right.

Eh?

Gold hair—shiny as silk—great, big, soft, black eyes—skin like milk and roses. [roses - розы] 

Don’t wonder Bernie fell for her.

And brains as well.

_

She_ wasn’t a bit of fluff.

B. A. from McGill.

A thoroughbred, too.

One of the best families.

But a bit lean in the purse.

Eh! Bernie was mad about her.

Happiest young fool  [fool - дурак] you ever saw.

Then—the bust-up.”  

“What happened?”

Valancy had taken off her hat and was absently thrusting a pin  [pin - булавка] in and out of it.

Good Luck was purring beside her.

Banjo was regarding Dr. Redfern with suspicion. [suspicion - подозрение] 

Nip and Tuck were lazily cawing in the pines. [pines - сосны] 

Mistawis was beckoning.

Everything was the same.

Nothing was the same.

It was a hundred years since yesterday.

Yesterday, at this time, she and Barney had been eating a belated dinner here with laughter.

Laughter?

Valancy felt that she had done with laughter forever.

And with tears, for that matter.

She had no further use for either of them.  

“Blest if I know, my dear. [dear - дорогой] 

Some fool  [fool - дурак] quarrel, [quarrel - ссора]  I suppose.

Bernie just lit out—disappeared.

He wrote me from the Yukon.

Said his engagement  [engagement - помолвка] was broken and he wasn’t coming back.

And not to try to hunt him up because he was never coming back.

I didn’t.

What was the use?

I knew Bernie.

I went on piling, up money because there wasn’t anything else to do.

But I was mighty lonely.

All I lived for was them little notes now and then from Bernie—Klondike—England—South Africa—China—everywhere.

I thought maybe he’d come back some day to his lonesome old dad.

Then six years ago even the letters stopped.

I didn’t hear a word of or from him till last Christmas.”  

“Did he write?”  

“No.

But he drew a check for fifteen thousand dollars on his bank account.

The bank manager is a friend of mine—one of my biggest shareholders. [shareholders - акционеры] 

He’d always promised me he’d let me know if Bernie drew any checks.

Bernie had fifty thousand there.

And he’d never touched a cent of it till last Christmas.

The check was made out to Aynsley’s, Toronto——”  “Aynsley’s?”

Valancy heard herself saying Aynsley’s!

Drawing that fifteen told me there was something in the wind.

The manager communicated with the Aynsleys—his wife was an Aynsley—and found out that Bernard Redfern had bought a pearl  [pearl - жемчужина] necklace there.

His address was given as Box 444, Port Lawrence, Muskoka, Ont.

First I thought I’d write.

Then I thought I’d wait till the open season for cars and come down myself.

Ain’t no hand at writing.

I’ve motored from Montreal.

Got to Port Lawrence yesterday.

Enquired at the post-office.

Told me they knew nothing of any Bernard Snaith Redfern, but there was a Barney Snaith had a P. O. box there.

Lived on an island out here, they said.

So here I am.

And where’s Barney?”  Valancy was fingering her necklace.

She was wearing fifteen thousand dollars around her neck.

And she had worried lest Barney had paid fifteen dollars for it and couldn’t afford it.

Suddenly she laughed in Dr. Redfern’s face.  

“Excuse me.

It’s so—amusing, [amusing - забавный] ” said poor Valancy.  

“Isn’t it?” said Dr. Redfern, seeing a joke—but not exactly hers.

“Now, you seem like a sensible  [sensible - разумный] young woman, and I dare  [dare - смеется] say you’ve lots of influence over Bernie.

Can’t you get him to come back to civilisation and live like other people?

I’ve a house up there.

Big as a castle.

Furnished like a palace.

I want company in it—Bernie’s wife—Bernie’s children.”  

“Did Ethel Traverse ever marry?” queried  [queried - вопрошает] Valancy irrelevantly.  

“Bless  [Bless - благослови] you, yes.

Two years after Bernie levanted.

But she’s a widow  [widow - вдова] now.

Pretty as ever.

To be frank, that was my special reason for wanting to find Bernie.

I thought they’d make it up, maybe.

But, of course, that’s all off now.

Doesn’t matter.

Bernie’s choice of a wife is good enough for me.

It’s my boy I want.

Think he’ll soon be back?”  

“I don’t know.

But I don’t think he’ll come before night.

Quite late, perhaps.

And perhaps not till tomorrow.

But I can put you up comfortably. [comfortably - спокойно] 

He’ll certainly be back tomorrow.”  

Dr. Redfern shook his head.  

“Too damp.

I’ll take no chances with rheumatism.”  

“Why suffer that ceaseless  [ceaseless - непрестанно] anguish? [anguish - тоска] 

Why not try Redfern’s Liniment?”

quoted  [quoted - цитируется] the imp  [imp - бес] in the back of Valancy’s mind.  

“I must get back to Port Lawrence before rain starts.

Henry goes quite mad when he gets mud on the car.

But I’ll come back tomorrow.

Meanwhile you talk Bernie into reason.”  

He shook her hand and patted her kindly on the shoulder.

He looked as if he would have kissed her, with a little encouragement, [encouragement - поощрение]  but Valancy did not give it.

Not that she would have minded. [minded - мыслящий] 

A score of times over.

And Barney was his son—and heir.  

She took him over in the motor boat and watched the lordly purple car roll away through the woods with Henry at the wheel looking things not lawful to be uttered. [uttered - изрек] 

Then she went back to the Blue Castle.

What she had to do must be done quickly.

Barney _

might_

return at any moment.

And it was certainly going to rain.

She was thankful she no longer felt very bad.

When you are bludgeoned on the head repeatedly, you naturally and mercifully become more or less insensible and stupid.  

She stood briefly  [briefly - кратко] like a faded  [faded - померк] flower bitten by frost, by the hearth, looking down on the white ashes of the last fire that had blazed  [blazed - пылал] in the Blue Castle.  

“At any rate,” she thought wearily, “Barney isn’t poor.

He will be able to afford a divorce. [divorce - развод] 

Quite nicely. [nicely - красиво] ”     

CHAPTER XXXIX   

She must write a note.

The imp  [imp - чертенок] in the back of her mind laughed.

In every story she had ever read when a runaway  [runaway - убежал] wife decamped from home she left a note, generally on the pin- [pin - булавка] cushion.

It was not a very original idea.

But one had to leave something intelligible.

What was there to do but write a note?

She looked vaguely about her for something to write with.

Ink? [Ink - чернила] 

There was none.

Valancy had never written anything since she had come to the Blue Castle, save memoranda of household necessaries for Barney.

A pencil sufficed  [sufficed - хватало] for them, but now the pencil was not to be found.

Valancy absently crossed to the door of Bluebeard’s Chamber and tried it.

She vaguely expected to find it locked, but it opened unresistingly.

She had never tried it before, and did not know whether Barney habitually kept it locked or not.

If he did, he must have been badly upset to leave it unlocked.

She did not realise that she was doing something he had told her not to do.

She was only looking for something to write with.

All her faculties  [faculties - способности] were concentrated on deciding just what she would say and how she would say it.

There was not the slightest  [slightest - малейшее] curiosity  [curiosity - любопытство] in her as she went into the lean-to.  

There were no beautiful women hanging by their hair on the walls.

Used no doubt by Barney in his smelly operations.

Chemical experiments, probably, she reflected dully.

At the other end was a big writing desk and swivel-chair.

The side walls were lined  [lined - подкладка] with books.  

Valancy went blindly  [blindly - вслепую] to the desk.

There she stood motionless for a few minutes, looking down at something that lay on it.

A bundle of galley-proofs.

The page on top bore the title _Wild Honey_, and under the title were the words “by John Foster.”  

The opening sentence—“Pines are the trees of myth  [myth - миф] and legend. [legend - легенда] 

They strike their roots deep into the traditions of an older world, but wind and star love their lofty tops.

What music when old Æolus draws his bow across the branches of the pines— [pines - сосны] ” She had heard Barney say that one day when they walked under them.  

So Barney was John Foster!  

Valancy was not excited.

She had absorbed  [absorbed - поглощенный] all the shocks and sensations  [sensations - ощущения] that she could compass for one day.

This affected her neither one way nor the other.

She only thought:  “So this explains it.”  

“It” was a small matter that had, somehow, stuck in her mind more persistently than its importance seemed to justify. [justify - оправдать] 

Soon after Barney had brought her John Foster’s latest book she had been in a Port Lawrence bookshop and heard a customer ask the proprietor  [proprietor - собственник] for John Foster’s new book.

The proprietor  [proprietor - собственник] had said curtly, “Not out yet.

Won’t be out till next week.”  

Valancy had opened her lips to say, “Oh, yes, it _is_ out,” but closed them again.

After all, it was none of her business.

She supposed the proprietor  [proprietor - собственник] wanted to cover up his negligence in not getting the book in promptly. [promptly - незамедлительно] 

Now she knew.

The book Barney had given her had been one of the author’s complimentary  [complimentary - бесплатно] copies, sent in advance. [advance - аванс]   

Well!

Valancy pushed the proofs indifferently aside  [aside - в сторону] and sat down in the swivel-chair.

She took up Barney’s pen—and a vile one it was—pulled a sheet of paper to her and began to write.

She could not think of anything to say except bald facts.   

“Dear Barney:—  I went to Dr. Trent this morning and found out he had sent me the wrong letter by mistake.

There never was anything serious the matter with my heart

and I am quite well now.  

Is desertion  [desertion - дезертирство] a ground for divorce  [divorce - развод] in Canada?

Of course if there is anything I can do to help or hasten it I will do it gladly, if your lawyer will let me know.  

I thank you for all your kindness to me.

I shall never forget it.

Think as kindly of me as you can, because I did not mean to trap  [trap - ловушка] you.

Good-bye.  Yours gratefully,  VALANCY.”   

It was very cold and stiff, [stiff - жесткая]  she knew.

But to try to say anything else would be dangerous—like tearing away a dam. [dam - плотина] 

She didn’t know what torrent of wild incoherences and passionate  [passionate - страстный] anguish  [anguish - тоска] might pour out.

In a postscript she added:   “Your father was here today.

He is coming back tomorrow.

He told me everything.

I think you should go back to him.

He is very lonely for you.”   

She put the letter in an envelope, [envelope - конверт]  wrote “Barney” across it, and left it on the desk.

On it she laid the string of pearls. [pearls - жемчуг] 

If they had been the beads she believed them she would have kept them in memory of that wonderful year.

But she could not keep the fifteen thousand dollar gift of a man who had married her out of pity  [pity - жалость] and whom she was now leaving.

It hurt her to give up her pretty bauble.

That was an odd  [odd - нечетный] thing, she reflected.

The fact that she was leaving Barney did not hurt her—yet.

It lay at her heart like a cold, insensible thing.

If it came to life—Valancy shuddered and went out——  She put on her hat and mechanically  [mechanically - механически] fed Good Luck and Banjo.

She locked the door and carefully hid the key in the old pine. [pine - сосна] 

Then she crossed to the mainland  [mainland - материк] in the disappearing propeller.

She stood for a moment on the bank, looking at her Blue Castle.

The rain had not yet come, but the sky was dark, and Mistawis grey and sullen.

She felt that she ought to knock like a stranger.

Her rosebush, she idly  [idly - лениво] noticed, was loaded  [loaded - загрузил] with buds. [buds - бутоны] 

The rubber-plant stood beside the prim door.

A momentary  [momentary - мимолетно] horror overcame  [overcame - преодолел] her—a horror of the existence to which she was returning.

Then she opened the door and walked in.  

“I wonder if the Prodigal Son ever felt really at home again,” she thought.  

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles were in the sitting- [sitting - сидя] room.

Uncle Benjamin was there, too.

They looked blankly  [blankly - тупо] at Valancy, realising at once that something was wrong.

This was not the saucy, impudent thing who had laughed at them in this very room last summer.

This was a grey-faced  [faced - лицо] woman with the eyes of a creature who had been stricken by a mortal  [mortal - смертельный] blow. [blow - удар]   

Valancy looked indifferently around the room.

She had changed so much—and it had changed so little.

The same pictures hung on the walls.

The little orphan who knelt  [knelt - преклонил колени] at her never-finished  [finished - кончил] prayer by the bed whereon reposed the black kitten that never grew up into a cat.

The grey “steel engraving” of Quatre Bras, where the British regiment  [regiment - полк] forever stood at bay. [bay - бухта] 

The crayon enlargement of the boyish  [boyish - мальчишеский] father she had never known.

There they all hung in the same places.

The same elaborate, [elaborate - вычурный]  never-used pitcher stood at the same angle on the sideboard shelf.

The blue and gilt vases that had been among her mother’s wedding-presents still primly adorned  [adorned - украшенный] the mantelpiece, flanking the china clock of berosed and besprayed ware that never went.

The chairs in exactly the same places.

Her mother and Cousin Stickles, likewise  [likewise - тоже] unchanged, [unchanged - неизменный]  regarding her with stony unwelcome.  

Valancy had to speak first.  

“I’ve come home, Mother,” she said tiredly.  

“So I see.”

Mrs. Frederick’s voice was very icy. [icy - ледяной] 

She had resigned  [resigned - смиренный] herself to Valancy’s desertion. [desertion - дезертирство] 

She had almost succeeded in forgetting there was a Valancy.

She had rearranged and organised her systematic  [systematic - систематический] life without any reference  [reference - ссылка] to an ungrateful, rebellious  [rebellious - бунтующий] child.

She had taken her place again in a society which ignored the fact that she had ever had a daughter and pitied her, if it pitied her at all, only in discreet whispers and asides.

The plain truth was that, by this time, Mrs. Frederick did not want Valancy to come back—did not want ever to see or hear of her again.  

And now, of course, Valancy was here.

With tragedy  [tragedy - трагедия] and disgrace  [disgrace - позор] and scandal  [scandal - скандал] trailing  [trailing - плетущийся] after her visibly. [visibly - видимо] 

“So I see,” said Mrs. Frederick.

“May I ask why?”  

“Because—I’m—not—going to die,” said Valancy huskily.  

Nothing else was worrying her; but all at once it seemed that she simply could not endure  [endure - терпеть] that thin, insistent rattle. [rattle - греметь]   

“My home, as I told you, is always open to you,” said Mrs. Frederick stonily, “but I can never forgive you.”  

Valancy gave a mirthless laugh.  

“I’d care very little for that if I could only forgive myself,” she said.  

“Come, come,” said Uncle Benjamin testily.

But rather enjoying himself.

He felt he had Valancy under his thumb  [thumb - большой палец] again.

“We’ve had enough of mystery.

What has happened?

Why have you left that fellow?

No doubt there’s reason enough—but what particular  [particular - особенно] reason is it?”  

Valancy began to speak mechanically. [mechanically - механически] 

She told her tale bluntly  [bluntly - прямо] and barely. [barely - едва]   

“A year ago Dr. Trent told me I had angina pectoris and could not live long.

I wanted to have some—life—before I died.

That’s why I went away.

Why I married Barney.

And now I’ve found it is all a mistake.

There is nothing wrong with my heart.

I’ve got to live—and Barney only married me out of pity. [pity - жалко] 

So I have to leave him—free.”  

“God bless  [bless - благословите] me!” said Uncle Benjamin.

Cousin Stickles began to cry.  

“Valancy, if you’d only had confidence in your own mother——”  “Yes, yes, I know,” said Valancy impatiently. [impatiently - нетерпеливо] 

“What’s the use of going into that now?

I can’t undo this year.

God knows I wish I could.

I’ve tricked  [tricked - обманул] Barney into marrying me—and he’s really Bernard Redfern.

Dr. Redfern’s son, of Montreal.

And his father wants him to go back to him.”  

Uncle Benjamin made a queer  [queer - чудак] sound.

Cousin Stickles took her black-bordered handkerchief away from her eyes and stared at Valancy.

A queer gleam  [gleam - блеск] suddenly shot into Mrs. Frederick’s stone-grey orbs.  

“Dr. Redfern—not the Purple Pill man?”

she said.  

Valancy nodded. [nodded - кивал] 

“He’s John Foster, too—the writer of those nature books.”  

“But—but—” Mrs. Frederick was visibly  [visibly - явно] agitated, though not over the thought that she was the mother-in-law of John Foster—“_Dr.

“Yes.

Barney left home years ago—because of—of some trouble—some—disappointment. [disappointment - разочарование] 

Now he will likely go back.

So you see—I had to come home.

He doesn’t love me.

I can’t hold him to a bond he was tricked  [tricked - обманули] into.”  

Uncle Benjamin looked incredibly sly.  

“Did he say so?

Does he want to get rid of you?”  

“No.

I haven’t seen him since I found out.

But I tell you—he only married me out of pity— [pity - жалость] because I asked him to—because he thought it would only be for a little while.”  

Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles both tried to speak, but Uncle Benjamin waved a hand at them and frowned portentously.  

“Let _me_ handle this,” wave and frown  [frown - нахмурился] seemed to say.

To Valancy:  “Well, well, dear, [dear - дорогой]  we’ll talk it all over later.

You see, we don’t quite understand everything yet.

As Cousin Stickles says, you should have confided  [confided - доверился] in us before.

Later on—I dare  [dare - осмелился] say we can find a way out of this.”  

“You think Barney can easily get a divorce, [divorce - развод]  don’t you?” said Valancy eagerly. [eagerly - нетерпеливо]   

Uncle Benjamin silenced with another wave the exclamation  [exclamation - восклицание] of horror he knew was trembling on Mrs. Frederick’s lips.  

“Trust to me, Valancy.

Everything will arrange itself.

Tell me this, Dossie.

Have you been happy up back?

Was Sr.—Mr.

Redfern good to you?”  

“I have been very happy and Barney was very good to me,” said Valancy, as if reciting a lesson.

She remembered when she studied grammar at school she had disliked the past and perfect tenses.

They had always seemed so pathetic.

“I have been”—it was all over and done with.  

“Then don’t worry, little girl.”

How amazingly  [amazingly - удивительно] paternal  [paternal - по-отечески] Uncle Benjamin was!

“Your family will stand behind you.

We’ll see what can be done.”  

“Thank you,” said Valancy dully.

Really, it was quite decent  [decent - прилично] of Uncle Benjamin.

“Can I go and lie down a little while?

I’m—I’m—tired.”  

“Of course you’re tired.”

Uncle Benjamin patted her hand gently— [gently - нежно]  [gently - нежно] very gently.

“All worn out and nervous.

Valancy smiled wanly.

But she had come back to the old life—the old shackles.

“What?” she asked as meekly as of yore.  

“Not to return it,” said Uncle Benjamin with a chuckle.

He shut the door and rubbed  [rubbed - тер] his hands.

Nodded  [Nodded - кивал] and smiled mysteriously  [mysteriously - загадочно] round the room.  

“Poor little Doss!”

he said pathetically.  

“Do you really suppose that—Snaith—can actually be Dr. Redfern’s son?” gasped Mrs. Frederick.  

“I see no reason for doubting  [doubting - сомневаясь] it.

She says Dr. Redfern has been there; Why, the man is rich as wedding-cake.

Amelia, I’ve always believed there was more in Doss than most people thought.

You kept her down too much—repressed  [repressed - подавленный] her.

She never had a chance to show what was in her.

And now she’s landed a millionaire  [millionaire - миллионер] for a husband.”  

“But—” hesitated Mrs. Frederick, “he—he—they told terrible tales about him.”  

“All gossip and invention—all gossip and invention.

It’s always been a mystery to me why people should be so ready to invent and circulate  [circulate - циркулировать] slanders about other people they know absolutely nothing about.

I can’t understand why you paid so much attention to gossip and surmise.

Just because he didn’t choose to mix up with everybody, people resented  [resented - обиженный] it.

I was surprised to find what a decent  [decent - порядочный] fellow he seemed to be that time he came into my store with Valancy.

I discounted all the yarns then and there.”  

“But he was seen dead drunk in Port Lawrence once,” said Cousin Stickles.

Doubtfully, [Doubtfully - Сомнительно]  yet as one very willing  [willing - готовый] to be convinced to the contrary.  

“Who saw him?” demanded Uncle Benjamin truculently.

“Who saw him?

Old Jemmy Strang _said_

he saw him.

I wouldn’t take old Jemmy Strang’s word on oath. [oath - присяга] 

He’s too drunk himself half the time to see straight.

He said he saw him lying drunk on a bench  [bench - скамейка] in the Park.

Pshaw!

Redfern’s been asleep there.

Don’t worry over _that_.”  

“But his clothes—and that awful old car—” said Mrs. Frederick uncertainly. [uncertainly - неуверенно]   

“Eccentricities of genius, [genius - гениальный] ” declared Uncle Benjamin.

“You heard Doss say he was John Foster.

“I—suppose—we must forgive her,” yielded  [yielded - уступил] Mrs. Frederick.  

“Forgive her!”

Uncle Benjamin snorted.

Really, Amelia was an incredibly stupid woman.

No wonder poor Doss had gone sick and tired of living with her.

“Well, yes, I think you’d better forgive her!

The question is—will Snaith forgive _us_!”  

“What if she persists  [persists - сохраняется] in leaving him?

You’ve no idea how stubborn she can be,” said Mrs. Frederick.  

“Leave it all to me, Amelia.

Leave it all to me.

You women have muddled it enough.

This whole affair has been bungled from start to finish.

If you had put yourself to a little trouble years ago, Amelia, she would not have bolted  [bolted - болтается] over the traces  [traces - следы] as she did.

Just let her alone—don’t worry her with advice or questions till she’s ready to talk.

She’s evidently  [evidently - очевидно] run away in a panic  [panic - паника] because she’s afraid he’d be angry with her for fooling him.

Most extraordinary thing of Trent to tell her such a yarn!

That’s what comes of going to strange doctors.

Well, well, we mustn’t blame her too harshly, poor child.

Redfern will come after her.

If he doesn’t, I’ll hunt him up and talk to him as man to man.

He may be a millionaire, [millionaire - миллионер]  but Valancy is a Stirling.

He can’t repudiate her just because she was mistaken about her heart disease.

Not likely he’ll want to.

Doss is a little overstrung.

Bless  [Bless - благослови] me, I must get in the habit of calling her Valancy.

She isn’t a baby any longer.

Now, remember, Amelia.

Be very kind and sympathetic. [sympathetic - сочувствующий] ”  

It was something of a large order to expect Mrs. Frederick to be kind and sympathetic. [sympathetic - сочувствующий] 

But she did her best.

When supper was ready she went up and asked Valancy if she wouldn’t like a cup of tea.

Valancy, lying on her bed, declined. [declined - отказался] 

She just wanted to be left alone for a while.

Mrs. Frederick left her alone.

She did not even remind Valancy that her plight  [plight - бедственное положение] was the outcome  [outcome - исход] of her own lack of daughterly respect and obedience. [obedience - послушание] 

One could not—exactly—say things like that to the daughter-in-law of a millionaire. [millionaire - миллионер]      

CHAPTER XLI   Valancy looked dully about her old room.

It, too, was so exactly the same that it seemed almost impossible to believe in the changes that had come to her since she had last slept in it.

It seemed—somehow—indecent that it should be so much the same.

Outside, the old carriage- [carriage - карета] shop with its blatant advertisements.

Beyond it, the station with the same derelicts and flirtatious flappers.  

Here the old life waited for her, like some grim  [grim - мрачный] ogre that bided his time and licked  [licked - вылизанный] his chops.

A monstrous horror of it suddenly possessed her.

When night fell and she had undressed and got into bed, the merciful numbness passed away and she lay in anguish  [anguish - тоска] and thought of her island under the stars.

The camp-fires—all their little household jokes and phrases and catch words—their furry beautiful cats—the lights agleam on the fairy islands—canoes  [canoes - каноэ] skimming  [skimming - слив] over Mistawis in the magic of morning—white birches shining among the dark spruces like beautiful women’s bodies—winter snows and rose-red sunset fires—lakes drunken  [drunken - пьяный] with moonshine—all the delights of her lost paradise.

She would not let herself think of Barney.

Only of these lesser things.

She could not endure  [endure - терпеть] to think of Barney.  

Then she thought of him inescapably.

She ached  [ached - болеет] for him.

She wanted his arms around her—his face against hers—his whispers in her ear.

She recalled all his friendly  [friendly - дружеский] looks and quips  [quips - шутки] and jests—his little compliments—his caresses.

She counted them all over as a woman might count her jewels—not one did she miss from the first day they had met.

These memories were all she could have now.

She shut her eyes and prayed.  

“Let me remember every one, God!

Let me never forget one of them!”  

Yet it would be better to forget.

This agony  [agony - агония] of longing and loneliness  [loneliness - одиночество] would not be so terrible if one could forget.

And Ethel Traverse.

That shimmering witch woman with her white skin and black eyes and shining hair.

The woman Barney had loved.

The woman whom he still loved.

Hadn’t he told her he never changed his mind?

Who was waiting for him in Montreal.

Who was the right wife for a rich and famous man.

Barney would marry her, of course, when he got his divorce. [divorce - развод] 

How Valancy hated her!

And envied  [envied - завидовал] her!

Barney had said, “I love you,” to _her_.

Valancy had wondered what tone Barney would say “I love you” in—how his dark-blue eyes would look when he said it.

Ethel Traverse knew.

She would never come to the little Mistawis shack at all.  

What was Barney doing—thinking—feeling now?

Had he come home and found her letter?

Was he still angry with her?

Or a little pitiful.

Was he lying on their bed looking out on stormy Mistawis and listening to the rain streaming down on the roof?

Or was he still wandering  [wandering - блуждание] in the wilderness, [wilderness - пустыня]  raging at the predicament  [predicament - затруднительное положение] in which he found himself?

Hating her?

Pain took her and wrung her like some great pitiless giant.

She got up and walked the floor.

Would morning never come to end this hideous night?

And yet what could morning bring her?

The old life without the old stagnation that was at least bearable.

The old life with the new memories, the new longings, the new anguish. [anguish - тоска]   

“Oh, why can’t I die?” moaned Valancy.     

CHAPTER XLII   

It was not until early afternoon the next day that a dreadful  [dreadful - ужасный] old car clanked up Elm Street and stopped in front of the brick  [brick - кирпич] house.

A hatless man sprang from it and rushed up the steps.

The bell was rung as it had never been rung before—vehemently, intensely.

The ringer was demanding entrance, not asking it.

Uncle Benjamin chuckled as he hurried to the door.

Uncle Benjamin had “just dropped in” to enquire  [enquire - вопросить] how dear Doss—Valancy was.

Dear Doss—Valancy, he had been informed, was just the same.

She had come down for breakfast—which she didn’t eat—gone back to her room, come down for dinner—which she didn’t eat—gone back to her room.

That was all.

She had not talked.

And she had been let, kindly, considerately, alone.  

“Very good.

Redfern will be here today,” said Uncle Benjamin.

And now Uncle Benjamin’s reputation as a prophet  [prophet - пророк] was made.

Redfern was here—unmistakably  [unmistakably - безошибочно] so.  

“Is my wife here?”

he demanded of Uncle Benjamin without preface.  

Uncle Benjamin smiled expressively.  

“Mr. Redfern, I believe?

Very glad to meet you, sir.

Yes, that naughty  [naughty - непослушный] little girl of yours is here.

We have been——”  “I must see her,” Barney cut Uncle Benjamin ruthlessly short.  

“Certainly, Mr. Redfern.

Just step in here.

Valancy will be down in a minute.”  

He ushered  [ushered - ввел] Barney into the parlour  [parlour - гостиная] and betook himself to the sitting- [sitting - сидя] room and Mrs. Frederick.  

“Go up and tell Valancy to come down.

Her husband is here.”  

But so dubious  [dubious - сомнительный] was Uncle Benjamin as to whether Valancy could really come down in a minute—or at all—that he followed Mrs. Frederick on tiptoe up the stairs and listened in the hall.  

“Oh, Mother.”

Valancy got up from the window and wrung her hands.

“I cannot see him—I cannot!

Tell him to go away—_ask_ him to go away.

I can’t see him!”  

“Tell her,” hissed Uncle Benjamin through the keyhole, [keyhole - замочная скважина]  “that Redfern says he won’t go away until he _has_ seen her.”  

Redfern had not said anything of the kind, but Uncle Benjamin thought he was that sort of a fellow.

Valancy knew he was.

She understood that she might as well go down first as last.  

She did not even look at Uncle Benjamin as she passed him on the landing. [landing - посадка] 

Uncle Benjamin did not mind.

Rubbing  [Rubbing - Трёт] his hands and chuckling, he retreated  [retreated - отступил] to the kitchen, where he genially demanded of Cousin Stickles:  “Why are good husbands like bread?”  

Cousin Stickles asked why.  

“Because women need them,” beamed Uncle Benjamin.  

Valancy was looking anything but beautiful when she entered the parlour. [parlour - гостиная] 

Her white night had played fearful havoc with her face.

She wore an ugly old brown-and-blue gingham, having left all her pretty dresses in the Blue Castle.

But Barney dashed  [dashed - тире] across the room and caught her in his arms.  

“Valancy, darling— [darling - душка] oh, you darling little idiot! [idiot - идиотка] 

Whatever possessed you to run away like that?

When I came home last night and found your letter I went quite mad.

It was twelve o’clock—I knew it was too late to come here then.

I walked the floor all night.

Then this morning Dad came—I couldn’t get away till now.

Valancy, whatever got into you?

Divorce, [Divorce - Развод]  forsooth!

Don’t you know——”  “I know you only married me out of pity, [pity - жалость] ” said Valancy, brushing him away feebly.

“I know you don’t love me—I know——”  “You’ve been lying awake at three o’clock too long,” said Barney, shaking her.

“That’s all that’s the matter with you.

Love you!

Oh, don’t I love you!

My girl, when I saw that train coming down on you I knew whether I loved you or not!”  

“Oh, I was afraid you would try to make me think you cared,” cried Valancy passionately. [passionately - страстно] 

“Don’t—don’t!

I _know_.

I know all about Ethel Traverse—your father told me everything.

Oh, Barney, don’t torture  [torture - пытка] me!

I can never go back to you!”  

Barney released her and looked at her for a moment.

Something in her pallid, resolute face spoke more convincingly than words of her determination. [determination - решимость]   

“Valancy,” he said quietly, “Father couldn’t have told you everything because he didn’t know it.

Will you let _me_

tell you—everything?”  

“Yes,” said Valancy wearily.

Oh, how dear he was!

How she longed to throw herself into his arms!

As he put her gently  [gently - нежно] down in a chair, she could have kissed the slender, brown hands that touched her arms.

She could not look up as he stood before her.

She dared not meet his eyes.

For his sake, [sake - ради]  she must be brave.

Never!  “You’ve seen Dad and you know I’m Bernard Redfern.

And I suppose you’ve guessed that I’m John Foster—since you went into Bluebeard’s Chamber.”  

“Yes.

But I didn’t go in out of curiosity. [curiosity - любопытство] 

I forgot you had told me not to go in—I forgot——”  “Never mind.

I’m not going to kill you and hang you up on the wall, so there’s no need  [need - потребность] to call for Sister Anne.

I’m only going to tell you my story from the beginning.

I came back last night intending to do it.

Yes, I’m ‘old Doc.

Redfern’s son’—of Purple Pills and Bitters fame. [fame - слава] 

Oh, don’t I know it?

Wasn’t it rubbed  [rubbed - натирание] into me for years?”  

Barney laughed bitterly  [bitterly - горько] and strode  [strode - ходьба] up and down the room a few times.

Uncle Benjamin, tiptoeing  [tiptoeing - на цыпочках] through the hall, heard the laugh and frowned.

Surely Doss wasn’t going to be a stubborn little fool. [fool - дурак] 

Barney threw himself into a chair before Valancy.  

“Yes.

As long as I can remember I’ve been a millionaire’ [millionaire - миллионер] s son.

But when I was born Dad wasn’t a millionaire. [millionaire - миллионер] 

He wasn’t even a doctor—isn’t yet.

He was a veterinary and a failure at it.

He and Mother lived in a little village up in Quebec and were abominably poor.

I don’t remember Mother.

Haven’t even a picture of her.

She died when I was two years old.

She was fifteen years younger than Father—a little school teacher.

When she died Dad moved into Montreal and formed a company to sell his hair tonic.

He’d dreamed the prescription  [prescription - рецепт] one night, it seems.

Well, it caught on.

Money began to flow in.

Dad invented—or dreamed—the other things, too—Pills, Bitters, Liniment and so on.

He was a millionaire  [millionaire - миллионер] by the time I was ten, with a house so big a small chap  [chap - парень] like myself always felt lost in it.

I had every toy a boy could wish for—and I was the loneliest little devil  [devil - дьявол] in the world.

I remember only one happy day in my childhood, Valancy.

Only one.

Even you were better off than that.

Dad had gone out to see an old friend in the country and took me along.

I was turned loose in the barnyard and I spent the whole day hammering  [hammering - долбящий] nails in a block of wood.

And most things went deep with me.

I was a sensitive  [sensitive - чувствительный]  [sensitive - чувствительный] child and I was even more sensitive as a boy.

No one ever knew what I suffered.

Dad never dreamed of it.  

“When he sent me to a private school—I was only eleven—the boys ducked me in the swimming-tank until I stood on a table and read aloud all the advertisements of Father’s patent  [patent - патентный] abominations.

I did it—then”—Barney clinched his fists—“I was frightened and half drowned  [drowned - утонувший] and all my world was against me.

But when I went to college and the sophs tried the same stunt I didn’t do it.”

Barney smiled grimly.

“They couldn’t make me do it.

But they could—and did—make my life miserable. [miserable - жалкий] 

I never heard the last of the Pills and the Bitters and the Hair Tonic.

‘After using’ was my nickname—you see I’d always such a thick thatch.

My four college years were a nightmare. [nightmare - кошмар] 

You know—or you don’t know—what merciless beasts  [beasts - звери] boys can be when they get a victim like me.

I had few friends—there was always some barrier  [barrier - барьер] between me and the kind of people I cared for.

And the other kind—who would have been very willing  [willing - желающий] to be intimate  [intimate - интимный] with rich old Doc.

Redfern’s son—I didn’t care for.

But I had one friend—or thought I had.

A clever, bookish  [bookish - книжный] chap— [chap - парень] a bit of a writer.

That was a bond between us—I had some secret aspirations  [aspirations - стремления] along that line.

He was older than I was—I looked up to him and worshipped him.

For a year I was happier than I’d ever been.

Then—a burlesque sketch  [sketch - набросок] came out in the college magazine—a mordant thing, ridiculing Dad’s remedies. [remedies - средства] 

The names were changed, of course, but everybody knew what and who was meant.

I found out _he_ had written it.”  

“Oh, were you sure?”

Valancy’s dull  [dull - унылый] eyes flamed with indignation.  

“Yes.

He admitted it when I asked him.

Said a good idea was worth more to him than a friend, any time.

And he added a gratuitous thrust.

‘You know, Redfern, there are some things money won’t buy.

For instance—it won’t buy you a grandfather.’

Well, it was a nasty  [nasty - противный] slam.

I was young enough to feel cut up.

And it destroyed a lot of my ideals and illusions, [illusions - иллюзии]  which was the worst thing about it.

I was a young misanthrope after that.

Didn’t want to be friends with any one.

And then—the year after I left college—I met Ethel Traverse.”  

Valancy shivered.

Barney, his hands stuck in his pockets, was regarding the floor moodily and didn’t notice it.  

“Dad told you about her, I suppose.

She was very beautiful.

And I loved her.

Oh, yes, I loved her.

I won’t deny it or belittle it now.

It was a lonely, romantic boy’s first passionate  [passionate - страстный] love, and it was very real.

And I thought she loved me.

I was fool  [fool - дурак] enough to think that.

I was wildly happy when she promised to marry me.

For a few months.

Then—I found out she didn’t.

I was an involuntary eavesdropper on a certain occasion for a moment.

That moment was enough.

The proverbial fate  [fate - судьба] of the eavesdropper overtook  [overtook - настигла] me.

A girl friend of hers was asking her how she could stomach Doc.

Redfern’s son and the patent- [patent - патент] medicine background.  

“‘His money will gild the Pills and sweeten the Bitters,’ said Ethel, with a laugh.

‘Mother told me to catch him if I could.

We’re on the rocks.

But pah!

I smell turpentine whenever he comes near me.’”  

“Oh, Barney!” cried Valancy, wrung with pity  [pity - жалость] for him.

She had forgotten all about herself and was filled with compassion  [compassion - сострадание] for Barney and rage  [rage - ярость] against Ethel Traverse.

How dared  [dared - осмелился] she?  

“Well,”—Barney got up and began pacing  [pacing - шагать] round the room—“that finished me.

Completely.

I left civilisation and those accursed dopes behind me and went to the Yukon.

For five years I knocked about the world—in all sorts of outlandish places.

I earned enough to live on—I wouldn’t touch a cent of Dad’s money.

Then one day I woke up to the fact that I no longer cared a hang  [hang - повесить] about Ethel, one way or another.

She was somebody I’d known in another world—that was all.

But I had no hankering to go back to the old life.

None of that for me.

I was free and I meant to keep so.

I came to Mistawis—saw Tom MacMurray’s island.

My first book had been published the year before, and made a hit—I had a bit of money from my royalties. [royalties - гонорар] 

I bought my island.

But I kept away from people.

In fact, I’m afraid I suggested a few of them myself.

By mysterious remarks  [remarks - замечания] which people interpreted  [interpreted - интерпретированный] in the light of their own prepossessions.  

“Then—you came.

I _had_ to believe you loved me—really loved _me_—not my father’s millions.

There was no other reason why you should want to marry a penniless devil  [devil - дьявол] with my supposed record.

And I was sorry for you.

Oh, yes, I don’t deny I married you because I was sorry for you.

And then—I found you the best and jolliest and dearest little pal and chum a fellow ever had.

Witty—loyal— [loyal - верный] sweet.

You made me believe again in the reality of friendship and love.

The world seemed good again just because you were in it, honey.

I’d have been willing  [willing - готовый] to go on forever just as we were.

I knew that, the night I came home and saw my homelight shining out from the island for the first time.

And knew you were there waiting for me.

After being homeless  [homeless - бездомный] all my life it was beautiful to have a home.

To come home hungry at night and know there was a good supper and a cheery fire—and _you_.  

“But I didn’t realise what you actually meant to me till that moment at the switch.

Then it came like a lightning flash. [flash - вспышка] 

I knew I couldn’t live without you—that if I couldn’t pull you loose in time I’d have to die with you.

I admit it bowled me over—knocked me silly.

I couldn’t get my bearings  [bearings - подшипники] for a while.

That’s why I acted like a mule.

But the thought that drove me to the tall timber  [timber - древесина] was the awful one that you were going to die.

I’d always hated the thought of it—but I supposed there wasn’t any chance for you, so I put it out of my mind.

Now I had to face it—you were under sentence of death and I couldn’t live without you.

When I came home last night I had made up my mind that I’d take you to all the specialists in the world—that something surely could be done for you.

I felt sure you couldn’t be as bad as Dr. Trent thought, when those moments on the track hadn’t even hurt you.

And I found your note—and went mad with happiness—and a little terror  [terror - ужас] for fear you didn’t care much for me, after all, and had gone away to get rid of me.

But now, it’s all right, isn’t it, darling? [darling - милая] ”  

Was she, Valancy being called “darling” [darling - милая] ?  

“I _can’t_ believe you care for me,” she said helplessly. [helplessly - беспомощно] 

“I _know_

you can’t.

What’s the use, Barney?

Of course, you’re sorry for me—of course you want to do the best you can to straighten  [straighten - выпрямляться] out the mess.

But it can’t be straightened  [straightened - выпрямляться] out that way.

You couldn’t love me—me.”

I hold you there like a jewel.

Didn’t I promise you I’d never tell you a lie?

Love you!

I love you with all there is of me to love.

Heart, soul, brain.

Every fibre  [fibre - волокно] of body and spirit thrilling to the sweetness of you.

There’s nobody in the world for me but you, Valancy.”  

“You’re—a good actor, Barney,” said Valancy, with a wan little smile.  

Barney looked at her.  

“So you don’t believe me—yet?”  

“I—can t.”  “Oh—damn! [damn - чертовка] ” said Barney violently.  

Valancy looked up startled.

She had never seen _this_

Barney.

Scowling!

Eyes black with anger.

Sneering lips.

Dead-white face.  

“You don’t want to believe it,” said Barney in the silk-smooth voice of ultimate  [ultimate - окончательная] rage. [rage - ярость] 

“You’re tired of me.

You want to get out of it—free from me.

You’re ashamed of the Pills and the Liniment, just as she was.

Your Stirling pride  [pride - гордость] can’t stomach them.

It was all right as long as you thought you hadn’t long to live.

A good lark— [lark - жаворонок] you could put up with me.

But a lifetime  [lifetime - время жизни] with old Doc Redfern’s son is a different thing.

Oh, I understand—perfectly.

I’ve been very dense— [dense - густой] but I understand, at last.”  

Valancy stood up.

She stared into his furious  [furious - яростный] face.

Then—she suddenly laughed.  

“You darling! [darling - милый] ”

she said.

“You do mean it!

You do really love me!

You wouldn’t be so enraged if you didn’t.”  

Barney stared at her for a moment.

Then he caught her in his arms with the little low laugh of the triumphant lover.  

Uncle Benjamin, who had been frozen with horror at the keyhole, [keyhole - замочная скважина]  suddenly thawed out and tiptoed  [tiptoed - на цыпочках] back to Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles.  

“Everything is all right,” he announced jubilantly.  

Dear little Doss!

He would send for his lawyer right away and alter  [alter - изменить] his will again.

Doss should be his sole  [sole - единственный] heiress.

To her that had should certainly be given.  

Mrs. Frederick, returning to her comfortable belief in an overruling Providence, got out the family Bible and made an entry under “Marriages.”     

CHAPTER XLIII   “But, Barney,” protested  [protested - протестный] Valancy after a few minutes, “your father—somehow—gave me to understand that you _still_ loved _her_.”  

“He would.

Even his Purple Pills do people whole heaps  [heaps - кучи] of good  [good - хороший] when they believe in them.”  

“But—I’m not fit for your life,” sighed  [sighed - вздохнул] Valancy.

“I’m not—clever—or well-educated—or——”  “My life is in Mistawis—and all the wild places of the world.

I’m not going to ask you to live the life of a society woman.

Of course, we must spend a bit of the time with Dad—he’s lonely and old——”  “But not in that big house of his,” pleaded  [pleaded - умолял] Valancy.

“I can’t live in a palace.”  

“Can’t come down to that after your Blue Castle,” grinned Barney.

“Don’t worry, sweet.

I couldn’t live in that house myself.

It has a white marble stairway  [stairway - лестницу] with gilt bannisters and looks like a furniture shop with the labels  [labels - ярлыки] off.

Likewise  [Likewise - Также] it’s the pride  [pride - гордость] of Dad’s heart.

We’ll get a little house somewhere outside of Montreal—in the real country—near enough to see Dad often.

I think we’ll build one for ourselves.

A house you build for yourself is so much nicer than a hand-me-down.

But we’ll spend our summers in Mistawis.

And our autumns travelling.

I want you to see the Alhambra—it’s the nearest thing to the Blue Castle of your dreams I can think of.

And there’s an old-world garden in Italy where I want to show you the moon rising over Rome through the dark cypress-trees.”  

“Will that be any lovelier than the moon rising over Mistawis?”  “Not lovelier.

But a different kind of loveliness. [loveliness - красоту] 

There are so many kinds of loveliness. [loveliness - красоту] 

Valancy, before this year you’ve spent all your life in ugliness.

You know nothing of the beauty of the world.

We’ll climb mountains—hunt for treasures  [treasures - сокровища] in the bazaars of Samarcand—search out the magic of east and west—run hand in hand to the rim  [rim - обод] of the world.

I want to show you it all—see it again through your eyes.

Girl, there are a million things I want to show you—do with you—say to you.

It will take a lifetime. [lifetime - жизнь] 

And we must see about that picture by Tierney, after all.”  

“Will you promise me one thing?” asked Valancy solemnly.  

“Anything,” said Barney recklessly.  

“Only one thing.

You are never, under any circumstances  [circumstances - обстоятельства] or under any provocation, to cast  [cast - бросок] it up to me that I asked you to marry me.”     

CHAPTER XLIV     E_xtract from letter written by Miss Olive Stirling to Mr. Cecil Bruce:_  

“It’s really disgusting that Doss’ crazy adventures should have turned out like this.

It makes one feel that there is no use in behaving properly.  

“I’m _sure_

her mind was unbalanced when she left home.

What she said about a dust-pile showed that.

Of course I don’t think there was ever a thing the matter with her heart.

I really think, Cecil, you should exercise more.

It doesn’t do to get too fleshy.  

“He also claims, I believe, to be John Foster.

We can believe _that_ or not, as we like, I suppose.  

“Old Doc Redfern has given them two millions for a wedding-present.

Evidently  [Evidently - Видно] the Purple Pills bring in the bacon.

They’re going to spend the fall in Italy and the winter in Egypt and motor through Normandy in apple-blossom  [blossom - цветок] time.

_

Not_ in that dreadful  [dreadful - ужасный] old Lizzie, though.

Redfern has got a wonderful new car.  

“Well, I think I’ll run away, too, and disgrace myself.

It seems to pay.  

“Uncle Ben is a scream.

Likewise  [Likewise - Также] Uncle James.

The fuss they all make over Doss now is absolutely sickening.

To hear Aunt Amelia talking of ‘my son-in-law, Bernard Redfern’ and ‘my daughter, Mrs. Bernard Redfern.’

Mother and Father are as bad as the rest.

And they can’t see that Valancy is just laughing at them all in her sleeve.”     

CHAPTER XLV   Valancy and Barney turned under the mainland  [mainland - материк] pines  [pines - сосны] in the cool dusk  [dusk - сумерки] of the September night for a farewell look at the Blue Castle.

Mistawis was drowned  [drowned - утонувший] in sunset lilac light, incredibly delicate  [delicate - нежный] and elusive. [elusive - неуловимый] 

Nip and Tuck were cawing lazily in the old pines. [pines - сосны] 

Good Luck and Banjo were mewed and mewing in separate baskets  [baskets - корзины] in Barney’s new, dark-green car _en route_ [route - маршрут]  to Cousin Georgiana’s.

Cousin Georgiana was going to take care of them until Barney and Valancy came back.

Aunt Wellington and Cousin Sarah and Aunt Alberta had also entreated the privilege  [privilege - привилегия] of looking after them, but to Cousin Georgiana was it given.

Valancy was in tears.  

“Don’t cry, Moonlight.

We’ll be back next summer.

And now we’re off for a real honeymoon.”  

Valancy smiled through her tears.

She was so happy that her happiness terrified  [terrified - ужас] her.
