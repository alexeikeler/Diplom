With a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, [swallows soaring - парящие ласточки]  the Festival of Summer came  [summer came - наступило лето] to the city Omelas, [city omelas - городские омелас]  bright-towered by the sea. The ringing of the boats in harbor sparkled  [harbor sparkled - гавань сверкала] with flags. In the streets between houses with red roofs  [red roofs - красные крыши] and painted walls, [painted walls - раскрашенные стены]  between old moss- [old moss - старый мох] grown  gardens and under avenues of trees, past great parks  [past great parks - мимо больших парков] and public buildings, [public buildings - общественные здания]  processions moved. [processions moved - шествия двигались] 

Some were decorous: old people  [old people - старики] in long stiff robes  [long stiff robes - длинные жесткие одежды] of mauve and gray, grave master workmen, [grave master workmen - могильные мастера]  quiet, merry women carrying  [merry women carrying - веселые женщины несли] their babies and chatting as they walked. In other streets the music beat faster, [music beat faster - музыка звучала быстрее]  a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, [people went dancing - люди пошли танцевать ]  the procession was a dance. Children dodged  [children dodged - дети увернулись] in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights  [crossing flights - пересекающиеся полеты] over the music and the singing. 

All the processions wound towards  [processions wound towards - процессии, свернутые в сторону] the north side  [north side - северная сторона] of the city, where on the great water- [great water - большая вода] meadow called  [meadow called - названный луг] the Green Fields boys  [green fields boys - зеленые поля мальчиков] and girls, naked in the bright air, [bright air - яркий воздух]  with mud-stained feet  [stained feet - запятнанные ноги] and ankles and long, lithe arms, [lithe arms - гибкие руки] exercised their restive horses  [restive horses - норовистые лошади] before the race. 

The horses wore  [horses wore - лошади носил] no gear at all but a halter without bit. [halter without bit - недоуздок без удил]  Their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green. They flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another; [one another - друг друга]  they were vastly excited, [vastly excited - сильно возбужденные]  the horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own. 

In the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding throughout  [music winding throughout - повсюду звучит музыка] the city streets, [city streets - городские улицы]  farther and nearer and ever approaching, [ever approaching - все приближающееся]  a cheerful faint sweetness  [cheerful faint sweetness - веселая слабая сладость] of the air from time to time trembled  [time trembled - время дрогнуло] and gathered together  [gathered together - собрались вместе] and broke out into the great joyous clanging  [great joyous clanging - большой радостный лязг] of the bells.
