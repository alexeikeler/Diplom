      "\n",

      "greying darkness.\n",
      "She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted\n",
      "to, for two reasons.\n",
      "She was afraid that crying might bring on another\n",

      "She had had a spell of it after\n",
      "she had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "_maidenly_ to think about _men_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a\n",
      "sense of humour nobody in her clan suspected.\n",
      "For that matter, there\n",
      "were a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected.\n",
      "But her\n",
      "laughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled,\n",
      "futile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and\n",

      "into her ugly, sordid room.\n",

      "looking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate\n",

      "the faded old motto, “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns\n",
      "about Great-grand-mother Stirling’s grim old face; the old photographs\n",
      "of ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below.\n",
      "There were\n",
      "only two pictures that were not of relatives.\n",
      "One, an old chromo of a\n",

      "driving rain!\n",
      "Why didn’t _some one_ open the door and let him in?\n",
      "The\n",
      "other picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise\n",
      "coming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had lavishly given her on\n",
      "her tenth birthday.\n",
      "For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated\n",

      "But she never dared\n",
      "destroy it or remove it.\n",
      "Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been\n",

      "have had a fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "People who\n",
      "wanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles\n",
      "believed, could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "of a fair and unknown land.\n",
      "Everything wonderful and beautiful was in\n",
      "that castle.\n",
      "Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and\n",
      "fire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps,\n",
      "with great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up\n",
      "and down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell\n",
      "and nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that\n",
      "reflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest\n",
      "of all, for whose glance men died.\n",
      "All that supported her through the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly\n",

      "necessarily handsome.\n",
      "At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual.\n",
      "At\n",
      "twenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong\n",
      "and rugged rather than handsome.\n",
      "Valancy never grew older than\n",
      "twenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently—very recently—her hero had\n",

      "heels like a maddening little dog.\n",
      "She was twenty-nine, lonely,\n",
      "undesired, ill-favoured—the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with\n",
      "no past and no future.\n",
      "As far as she could look back, life was drab and\n",
      "colourless, with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere.\n",
      "As far\n",
      "as she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until\n",
