      "If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole life would have been entirely different. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s engagement picnic and Dr. Trent would have gone to Montreal. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But it did rain and you shall hear what happened to her because of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding dawn. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not slept very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One does not sleep well, sometimes, when one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community and connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to get a man. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Deerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless old maidenhood. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a certain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way yet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the fact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ay, _there_ lay the sting. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as dreadful as being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin, or even an Uncle Herbert. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What hurt her was that she had never had a chance to be anything but an old maid. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No man had ever desired her. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly greying darkness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two reasons. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain around the heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had had a spell of it after she had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And she was afraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at her with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding the cause thereof. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Suppose,” thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, “I answered with the plain truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How horrified Mother would be—though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old maid daughter.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But of course appearances should be kept up. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not,” Valancy could hear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is not _maidenly_ to think about _men_.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a sense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For that matter, there were a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But her laughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled, futile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and watching, with a sick distaste, the chill, merciless light creeping into her ugly, sordid room. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. \n",

      "\n",
      "Rich, golden-brown hair, elaborately dressed, with a sparkling bandeau holding its glossy puffs in place; large, brilliant blue eyes and thick silken lashes; face of rose and bare neck of snow, rising above her gown; great pearl bubbles in her ears; the blue-white diamond flame on her long, smooth, waxen finger with its rosy, pointed nail. \n",

      "Olive was only a year younger than Valancy, though a stranger would have thought that there was at least ten years between them. \n",

      "\n",
      "But nobody ever dreaded old maidenhood for her. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At eighteen, when she had graduated from Havergal College, Olive had been engaged to Will Desmond, lawyer in embryo. \n",

      "Valancy knew also—though Olive had not told her—that the bridesmaids were selected and that she was not among them. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy had, after a fashion, always been Olive’s confidante—perhaps because she was the only girl in the connection who could not bore Olive with return confidences. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Olive always told Valancy all the details of her love affairs, from the days when the little boys in school used to “persecute” her with love letters. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy could not comfort herself by thinking these affairs mythical. \n",

      "\n",

      "Cousin Georgiana could never say anything as blunt as “die.” \n",

      "Uncle James thought the conversation was sagging to a rather low plane of personal gossip. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Frederick said the greatest happiness was to spend your life in loving service for others, and Cousin Stickles and Aunt Isabel agreed with her—Aunt Isabel with a resentful air, as if she thought Mrs. Frederick had taken the wind out of her sails by saying it first. \n",

      "Valancy, pale, subdued-looking, her slanted eyes smudged with purple, in her snuff-brown dress, moving quietly about, finding seats for people, consulting in undertones with minister and undertaker, marshalling the “mourners” into the parlour, was so decorous and proper and Stirlingish that her family took heart of grace. \n",

      "No beauty—but a fifty-year-old widower, Mr. Beck told himself very reasonably, couldn’t expect everything. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy was hating the funeral—hating the people who came to stare with curiosity at Cecilia’s marble-white face—hating the smugness—hating the dragging, melancholy singing—hating Mr. Bradly’s cautious platitudes. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If she could have had her absurd way, there would have been no funeral at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She would have covered Cissy over with flowers, shut her away from prying eyes, and buried her beside her nameless little baby in the grassy burying-ground under the pines of the “up back” church, with a bit of kindly prayer from the old Free Methodist minister. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered Cissy saying once, “I wish I could be buried deep in the heart of the woods where nobody would ever come to say, ‘Cissy Gay is buried here,’ and tell over my miserable story.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not look or feel at all bride-like—she really looked like a wild elf strayed out of the greenwood. \n",

      "Uncle Benjamin had once promised her a pair of skates for Christmas, but when Christmas came he had given her rubbers instead. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never skated since she grew up, but the old trick came back quickly, and glorious were the hours she and Barney spent skimming over the white lakes and past the dark islands where the summer cottages were closed and silent. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No wild effort to remember whether she hadn’t given the same kind of present to the same person two Christmases before—no mob of last-minute shoppers—no dreary family “reunions” where she sat mute and unimportant—no attacks of “nerves.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They decorated the Blue Castle with pine boughs, and Valancy made delightful little tinsel stars and hung them up amid the greenery. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a round, black jar on the chimney-piece Barney put money for their household expenses—always enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The jar was never empty, though Valancy never caught him replenishing it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He couldn’t have much, of course, and that necklace—but Valancy tossed care aside. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She would wear it and enjoy it. \n",

      "Now, she almost counted that night lost on which she didn’t wake up and lie awake for half an hour just being happy, while Barney’s regular breathing went on beside her, and through the open door the smouldering brands in the fireplace winked at her in the gloom. \n",

      "This was a grey-faced woman with the eyes of a creature who had been stricken by a mortal blow. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The plain truth was that, by this time, Mrs. Frederick did not want Valancy to come back—did not want ever to see or hear of her again. \n",

      "Why?”  “Because,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin, “they can’t decline matrimony.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two clerks, Joe Hammond and Claude Bertram, chuckled also, and Valancy disliked them a little more than ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first day Claude Bertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper to Joe, “Who is that?” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And Joe had said, “Valancy Stirling—one of the Deerwood old maids.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Curable or incurable?” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Claude had asked with a snicker, evidently thinking the question very clever. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy smarted anew with the sting of that old recollection.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Twenty-nine,” Uncle Benjamin was saying. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear me, Doss, you’re dangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting married yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-nine. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems impossible.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Uncle Benjamin said an original thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Benjamin said, “How time does fly!”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“_I_ think it _crawls_,” said Valancy passionately. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Passion was so alien to Uncle Benjamin’s conception of Valancy that he didn’t know what to make of her. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To cover his confusion, he asked another conundrum as he tied up her beans—Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last moment that they must have beans. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Beans were cheap and filling.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What two ages are apt to prove illusory?” asked Uncle Benjamin; and, not waiting for Valancy to “give it up,” he added, “Mir-age and marriage.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“M-i-r-a-g-e is pronounced _mirazh_,” said Valancy shortly, picking up her tea and her beans. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the moment she did not care whether Uncle Benjamin cut her out of his will or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked out of the store while Uncle Benjamin stared after her with his mouth open. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he shook his head.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Doss is taking it hard,” he said.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why had she lost her patience like that? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Uncle Benjamin would be annoyed and would likely tell her mother that Doss had been \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "impertinent—“to _me_!”—and her mother would lecture her for a week.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve held my tongue for twenty years,” thought Valancy. \n",

      "“Why couldn’t I have held it once more?”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, since she had first been twitted with her loverless condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered the bitter moment perfectly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on the school playground while the other little girls of her class were playing a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner before you could play. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody had chosen Valancy—little, pale, black-haired Valancy, with her prim, long-sleeved apron and odd, slanted eyes.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” said a pretty little girl to her, “I’m so sorry for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You haven’t got a beau.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy had said defiantly, as she continued to say for twenty years, “I don’t _want_ \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "a beau.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But this afternoon Valancy once and for all stopped saying that.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I _do_ want to be married. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I want a house of my own—I want a husband of my own—I want sweet, little fat _babies_ of my own—” Valancy stopped suddenly aghast at her own recklessness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who passed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved of them thoroughly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling—had been afraid of him ever since the Sunday, twenty-three years before, when he had first come to St. Albans’. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that day and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No one else was in the church—nobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Valancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle. \n",

      "\n",
      "Valancy took off her hat. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Oh, what would she do if that horrible, stabbing forefinger were shaken at her again before all those people? \n",

      "Valancy sat through the whole service in an agony of dread and was sick for a week afterwards. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And every one knew that he was an escaped convict and a defaulting bank clerk and a murderer in hiding and an infidel and an illegitimate son of old Roaring Abel Gay and the father of Roaring Abel’s illegitimate grandchild and a counterfeiter and a forger and a few other awful things. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It throve and grew luxuriantly, with great leafy branches untouched of rust or spider; but not even a bud had ever appeared on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy, looking at it two days after her birthday, was filled with a sudden, overwhelming hatred for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing wouldn’t bloom: very well, then, she would cut it down. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She marched to the tool-room in the barn for her garden knife and she went at the rosebush viciously. \n",

      "A few minutes later horrified Mrs. Frederick came out to the verandah and beheld her daughter slashing insanely among the rosebush boughs. \n",

      "She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too strong for her. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She said it deprecatingly. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "She cleared away the severed branches and swept up the leaves. \n",

      "Her lips twitched as she looked at the straggling bush. \n",
      "\n",

      "“I certainly have made an awful-looking thing of it,” thought Valancy.   \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He did it with such a detached, impersonal, Jove-like air, as if it did not matter in the least to him what supernal joys or shattering horrors might be in those letters for the people to whom they were addressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Letters had a fascination for Valancy, perhaps because she so seldom got any. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In her Blue Castle exciting epistles, bound with silk and sealed with crimson, were always being brought to her by pages in livery of gold and blue, but in real life her only letters were occasional perfunctory notes from relatives or an advertising circular.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently she was immensely surprised when Mr. Carewe, looking even more Jovian than usual, poked a letter out to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it was addressed to her plainly, in a fierce, black hand: “Miss Valancy Stirling, Elm Street, Deerwood”—and the postmark was Montreal. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Glorious open fires blazed in every room of her Blue Castle when autumnal nights were cool, but she would have frozen to death in it before she would have committed the sacrilege of a gas-log. \n",

      "Uncle Herbert made his hardy perennial joke when he helped Aunt Wellington to the cold meat—“Mary, will you have a little lamb?” \n",

      "\n",
      "Cousin Georgiana could never say anything as blunt as “die.” \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her visiting nephews had nipped all the buds off her house-plants and chivied her brood of fancy chickens—“squeezed some of them actually to death, my dear.”   \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Aunt Alberta remarked vaguely that the greatest happiness was to be found in “the poetry of life” and hastily gave some directions to her maid to prevent any one asking her what she meant. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Frederick said the greatest happiness was to spend your life in loving service for others, and Cousin Stickles and Aunt Isabel agreed with her—Aunt Isabel with a resentful air, as if she thought Mrs. Frederick had taken the wind out of her sails by saying it first. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are all too prone,” continued Mrs. Frederick, determined not to lose so good an opportunity, “to live in selfishness, worldliness and sin.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The other women all felt rebuked for their low ideals, and Uncle James had a conviction that the conversation had been uplifted with a vengeance.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The greatest happiness,” said Valancy suddenly and distinctly, “is to sneeze when you want to.”   \n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Frederick, who had been breathing easier since the dinner had progressed so far without any outbreak on the part of Valancy, began to tremble again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But she deemed it the part of prudence to say nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "And her lips moved tremblingly—as if she were praying. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps she was. \n",

      "Aunt Alberta, to save her dinner, plunged into an account of how a dog had bitten her recently. \n",
      "\n",

      "Uncle James, to back her up, asked where the dog had bitten her.   \n",
      "\n",

      "“Just a little below the Catholic church,” said Aunt Alberta.   \n",

      "“Is that a vital part?” asked Valancy.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?” said bewildered Aunt Alberta, and Mrs. Frederick was almost driven to believe that she had served God all her years for naught.   \n",

      "\n",
      "Aunt Isabel concluded that it was up to her to suppress Valancy.   \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The protest was wrung from Mrs. Frederick. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She meant her tone to be stately and majestic, as usual, but it sounded more like an imploring whine. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And she did not say “Doss.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“So there is that advantage, at least, in being twenty-nine,” said Valancy, whose ears had caught this aside.   \n",

      "“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, “when I am dead you may say what you please. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doss,” said Uncle Benjamin, thinking it might cow Valancy, “do you remember the time you stole the raspberry jam?”  Valancy flushed scarlet—with suppressed laughter, not shame. \n",

      "She had been sure Uncle Benjamin would drag that jam in somehow.   \n",

      "Did you ever see anything so funny?”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody looked, including Aunt Isabel herself, which of course, destroyed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Uncle Herbert said kindly, “I—I wouldn’t eat any more if I were you, Doss. \n",

      "It isn’t that I grudge it—but don’t you think it would be better for yourself? \n",

      "Your—your stomach seems a little out of order.”   \n",
      "\n",

      "It was the first time any one had been called “old dear” in Deerwood. \n",
      "\n",

      "The Stirlings thought Valancy had invented the phrase and they were afraid of her from that moment. \n",

      "\n",
      "There was something so uncanny about such an expression. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But in poor Mrs. Frederick’s opinion the reference to a satisfying meal was the worst thing Valancy had said yet. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Whatever he was, he was an individual that could not be ignored. \n",

      "She could feel her pulses beating to her finger-tips.   \n",

      "\n",
      "When a man hides himself up there on an island in Muskoka, year in and year out, and nobody can find out where he came from or how he lives, or what he does there, _that’s_ proof enough. \n",

      "Well, I’m obliged to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You helped me out of a bad hole and I won’t forget it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And I won’t forget what you did for Cissy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m your friend, and if you ever want any of the Stirlings spanked and sot in a corner send for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m going to wet my whistle. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord, but I’m dry! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t reckon I’ll be back afore tomorrow night, so if you’re going home tomorrow, good-bye now.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _may_ go home tomorrow,” said Valancy, “but I’m not going back to Deerwood.”  “Not going——”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll find the key on the woodshed nail,” interrupted Valancy, politely and unmistakably. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dog will be in the barn and the cat in the cellar. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The pantry is full and I made bread and pies today. \n",

      "“We’ve had a d——d decent time of it together, and that’s a fact,” said Roaring Abel. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re the best small sport in the world, and your little finger is worth the whole Stirling clan tied together. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good-bye and good-luck.”  Valancy went out to the garden. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her legs trembled a little, but otherwise she felt and looked composed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She held something tightly in her hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The garden was lying in the magic of the warm, odorous July twilight. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A few stars were out and the robins were calling through the velvety silences of the barrens. Valancy stood by the gate expectantly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Would he come? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If he did not——  He was coming. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy heard Lady Jane Grey far back in the woods. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her breath came a little more quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearer—and nearer—she could see Lady Jane now—bumping down the lane—nearer—nearer—he was there—he had sprung from the car and was leaning over the gate, looking at her.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Going home, Miss Stirling?”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know—yet,” said Valancy slowly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mind was made up, with no shadow of turning, but the moment was very tremendous.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought I’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for you,” said Barney.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy took it with a canter.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, there is something you can do for me,” she said, evenly and distinctly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will you marry me?”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment Barney was silent. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no particular expression on his face. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he gave an odd laugh.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, now! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew luck was just waiting around the corner for me. \n",

      "\n",
      "All the signs have been pointing that way today.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wait.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy lifted her hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m in earnest—but I want to get my breath after that question. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, with my bringing up, I realise perfectly well that this is one of the things ‘a lady should not do.’”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“But why—why?”  “For two reasons.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy was still a little breathless, but she looked Barney straight in the eyes, while all the dead Stirlings revolved rapidly in their graves and the living ones did nothing because they did not know that Valancy was at that moment proposing lawful marriage to the notorious Barney Snaith. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first reason is, I—I”—Valancy tried to say “I love you” but could not. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had to take refuge in a pretended flippancy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m crazy about you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The second is—this.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She handed him Dr. Trent’s letter.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Barney opened it with the air of a man thankful to find some safe, sane thing to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As he read it his face changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He understood—more perhaps than Valancy wanted him to.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you sure nothing can be done for you?”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy did not misunderstand the question.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You know Dr. Trent’s reputation in regard to heart disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven’t long to live—perhaps only a few months—a few weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to _live_ \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "them. \n",
      "\n",

      "I can’t go back to Deerwood—you know what my life was like there. \n",

      "\n",
      "I want to spend the rest of my life with you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s all.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Barney folded his arms on the gate and looked gravely enough at a white, saucy star that was winking at him just over Roaring Abel’s kitchen chimney.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know anything about me. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“You care that much for me, Valancy?” said Barney incredulously, looking away from the star and into her eyes—her strange, mysterious eyes.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“I care—that much,” said Valancy in a low voice. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She was trembling. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He had called her by her name for the first time. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was sweeter than another man’s caress could have been just to hear him say her name like that.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we are going to get married,” said Barney, speaking suddenly in a casual, matter-of-fact voice, “some things must be understood.”   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everything must be understood,” said Valancy.   \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Especially a petty lie,” agreed Valancy.   \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If I drop dead suddenly—as I likely will do——”  “It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion of having poisoned you,” said Barney with a grin.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Exactly.” \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It has been—a bit of an ordeal. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, I’m not in the habit of going about asking men to marry me. \n",
      "\n",

      "“Besides, he wouldn’t do it. \n",
      "\n",

      "A passing car, full of tourists, honked loudly—it seemed derisively. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The next day passed for Valancy like a dream. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Valancy was waiting at the gate for her bridegroom. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She wore her green dress and her green hat because she had nothing else to wear. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not look or feel at all bride-like—she really looked like a wild elf strayed out of the greenwood. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But that did not matter. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing at all mattered except that Barney was coming for her.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "“Yes.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy stepped in and sat down. \n",

      "\n",
      "Barney was in his blue shirt and overalls. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But they were clean overalls. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He was smoking a villainous-looking pipe and he was bareheaded. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had a pair of oddly smart boots on under his shabby overalls. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he was shaved. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They clattered into Deerwood and through Deerwood and hit the long, wooded road to the Port.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "That was their whole conversation on the fifteen miles. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Or terrified. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Or just plain fool.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the lights of Port Lawrence were about them. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "They stopped before the shabby little house in an unfashionable street. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Barney produced his license. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So he _had_ got it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also a ring. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This thing was real. \n",

      "\n",
      "White silk and tulle veil and orange-blossoms; no bridesmaid. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But one flower girl, in a frock of cream shadow lace over pale pink, with a wreath of flowers in her hair, carrying a basket of roses and lilies-of-the-valley. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the groom, a noble-looking creature, irreproachably clad in whatever the fashion of the day decreed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valancy lifted her eyes and saw herself and Barney in the little, slanting, distorting mirror over the mantelpiece. \n",

      "\n",
      "No veil—no flowers—no guests—no presents—no wedding-cake—but just Barney. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Snaith, I hope you will be very happy,” Mr. Towers was saying.   \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“The two oldest are grown up and the third almost. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So much easier to bring up than girls. \n",

      "\n",
      "Cousin Georgiana had a tremendous respect for a married woman. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course Valancy must be stark mad. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Wonderful.   \n",

      "“My cutting it to pieces must have done it good,” said Valancy, laughing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She gathered a handful of the blossoms—they would look well on the supper-table of the verandah at Mistawis—and went, still laughing, up the walk, conscious that Olive was standing on the steps, Olive, goddess-like in loveliness, looking down with a slight frown on her forehead. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Olive, beautiful, insolent. \n",

      "\n",

      "So Valancy had come home, thank goodness, thought Olive. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "That outlandish dress—that queer hat—those hands full of blood-red roses. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet there was something about both dress and hat, as Olive instantly felt, that was entirely lacking in her own attire. \n",
      "\n",

      "This deepened the frown. \n",
      "\n",

      "There was a certain sunlit dell on the banks of Mistawis along which white birches grew on one side and on the other still, changeless ranks of young spruces. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There were long grasses at the roots of the birches, combed down by the winds and wet with morning dew late into the afternoons. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here they found berries that might have graced the banquets of Lucullus, great ambrosial sweetnesses hanging like rubies to long, rosy stalks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They lifted them by the stalk and ate them from it, uncrushed and virgin, tasting each berry by itself with all its wild fragrance ensphered therein. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Valancy carried any of these berries home that elusive essence escaped and they became nothing more than the common berries of the market-place—very kitchenly good indeed, but not as they would have been, eaten in their birch dell until her fingers were stained as pink as Aurora’s eyelids.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Or they went after water-lilies. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all they took with them were some raw potatoes and salt. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Never were such delicious meals. \n",

      "But Barney made a fragrant bed of bracken and fir boughs and they slept on it dreamlessly, under a ceiling of old spruces with moss hanging from them, while beyond them moonlight and the murmur of pines blended together so that one could hardly tell which was light and which was sound.   \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a low, noble brow, a straight, classic nose, lips and chin and cheek-curve modelled as if some goddess of old time had sat to the sculptor, and a breast of such cold, swelling purity as the very spirit of the winter woods might display.   \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is really nothing but pure white after all, but one has the impression of fairy-like blendings of rose and violet, opal and heliotrope on the slopes—in the dingles and along the curves of the forest-land. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You feel sure the tint is there, but when you look at it directly it is gone. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never skated since she grew up, but the old trick came back quickly, and glorious were the hours she and Barney spent skimming over the white lakes and past the dark islands where the summer cottages were closed and silent. \n",
